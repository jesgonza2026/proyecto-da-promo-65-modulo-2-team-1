        "biografia":"Anne-Marie Nicholson, born in Essex, England, was no stranger to performing by the time her debut EP dropped in 2015, having shared the stage as a 12-year-old with Jessie J in a West End production of Whistle Down the Wind. She also auditioned for Les Misérables without telling her parents, and was offered a part. It was a risk that paid off, as it served to open her parents' eyes to her singing ability. Aside from West End commitments, the intervening years between her days as a child star and the advent of her career as a pop singer were spent becoming a world karate champion no fewer than three times, an art form she credited with teaching her discipline and focus, two essential traits of becoming a successful musician.\n\nAfter a chance meeting with an aspiring singer\/songwriter, she managed to secure some studio time in Elton John's Rocket Studios, and, after hearing what she could do, she was subsequently picked up by Elton's management company Rocket Music. Anne-Marie released a demo in 2013 entitled Summer Girl, which drew some attention to the singer, most notably garnering a fan in Ed Sheeran. Despite the encouraging start to her solo career, things were put on hold to give her more time to develop as an artist.\n\nHaving guested on tracks by dubstep supergroup Magnetic Man, London-based garage duo Gorgon City, and progressive house trio Raized by Wolves, Anne-Marie caught the attention of Brit and MOBO award winners Rudimental. She was featured alongside Dizzee Rascal and Will Heard on two tracks from their second album, 2015's We the Generation, and spent two years touring with the band, playing some of the world's biggest stages and best-known festivals.\n\nThe summer of that year also saw the release of Anne-Marie's debut EP on Rudimental's then-new record label, Major Tom's. The aptly titled Karate EP featured three tracks and a Chloe Martini remix, and producers Josh Record and Two Inch Punch worked with her on the record. Both the lead single \"Karate,\" a slick fusion of electro-grime and R&B, and the follow-up \"Gemini,\" garnered some very positive reviews and led Anne-Marie to gigging as a solo artist. In early 2016, the single \"Do It Right\" reached the U.K. charts, and several months later \"Alarm\" hit the Top 40 in several charts around the world.\n\nIn 2017, Anne-Marie scored a hit single when she featured on Clean Bandit's multi-platinum \"Rockabye\" with Sean Paul. The song topped the charts across Europe and in Australia, breaking into the Top Ten in Canada and the U.S. She followed with the solo singles \"Ciao Adios\" and \"Heavy,\" which both charted in the U.K. and Ireland. Both tracks appeared on her debut full-length, Speak Your Mind, which saw release in April 2018. The record also featured the track \"Friends,\" written and recorded with American dance producer Marshmello. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Anne-Marie\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Kurt Hugo Schneider (born September 7, 1988) is an American video editor, producer, musician, singer and songwriter, whose primary medium is YouTube music videos. He produces music videos for various YouTube musicians, such as Sam Tsui, including the musical medley videos in which Tsui sings as a one-man choir, and Avicii's \"Waiting For Love\".\n\nSchneider was born in Baltimore, Maryland to Laurie S. Auth, a visual artist, and Michael Schneider, a mathematician. He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia, where he lived just a street away from Sam Tsui, whom he met while attending middle school. They both later attended Wissahickon High School. He is of German and Austrian descent on his father's side but does not speak German. Schneider has an older sister who is a classical pianist. He graduated as class Valedictorian from Wissahickon, and magna cum laude from Yale University in 2010 with a degree in mathematics and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa.\nSchneider played for Yale's chess team. He currently holds a USCF Elo rating of 2235 and can play multiple games of chess blindfolded simultaneously. He played against Magnus Carlsen at the CES 2014 HRM Chess Tournament, hosted by Nordic Semiconductor in Las Vegas. He is also a self-taught musician.\nAccording to Business Insider and SocialBlade, he is believed to make over a six-figure income from YouTube.\n\nSchneider began collaborating with Tsui while both were in high school and continued while they were at Yale; Schneider matriculated a year before. He produced videos of Tsui singing covers and medleys, and has since made an online musical series (College Musical) and produced original songs.\nThey garnered wide media attention with a video of a Michael Jackson medley. This video remains the 9th most viewed (more than 34 million) on Schneider's YouTube channel KurtHugoSchneider. This medley is one of several in which Schneider, using video editing, creates the illusion of a one-man a cappella choir, with Tsui covering lead and backing vocals, playing multiple versions of himself. Their medley videos have been described by Time as a combination of Glee and Attack of the Clones. The viral videos led to a few appearances on national television, including The Oprah Winfrey Show and The Ellen DeGeneres Show. On February 3, 2011, Schneider's video of Tsui covering Hold It Against Me, in which Tsui sang and played the piano with Schneider on percussion, was featured on Britney Spears' official website.\nThe popularity of their videos has encouraged the duo to branch out to other projects. Shooting for an independent film, College Musical: The Movie, based upon their online musical series, has been completed in the summer of 2010 and the film was released September 3, 2014. A series of behind-the-scenes videos for the movie, filmed and narrated by Nick Uhas, has been released on YouTube. Since September 2010, Schneider and Tsui have also begun to release videos of original songs and in May 2013, Sam Tsui's debut original album, \"Make It Up\", was released.\n\nSchneider has also made music videos in collaboration with other artists. Popular videos include a Miley Cyrus medley sung by Christina Grimmie, a duet between Tsui and Grimmie singing Just a Dream (the most viewed video on 'KurtHugoSchneider', with over a hundred and twenty million views), and a Starcraft-themed parody video, with Husky, of Baby. He has also parodied the infamous \"Friday\" by Rebecca Black with his variation being known as \"Void Rays\". He has collaborated with Tiffany Alvord on a Taylor Swift Medley and Matisse on a Medley of Rihanna songs. He has also collaborated with Max Schneider on a number of occasions: for example he directed a Bruno Mars medley for Max Schneider & Victoria Justice, a Maroon 5 Medley and a Christmas Medley. Schneider also co-wrote 'Standing In China' with Max Schneider for Cody Simpson's album Paradise. Schneider was also an associate producer for a musical admissions video for Yale, which features a cast consisting of Tsui and fellow Yale students.\nHe has also performed a cover of Beauty and the Beat by Justin Bieber with Alex Goot and Chrissy Costanza from Against the Current as well as a cover of Counting Stars by OneRepublic and a cover of Heart Attack by Demi Lovato.\n\nIn 2013, Schneider and Coca-Cola created music videos featuring creative covers of two 2013 singles: Calvin Harris' \"Feel So Close\" and Of Monsters and Men's \"Little Talks\" for a campaign called \"The Sounds of AHH\". Commercial edits of the singles premiered on the inaugural episode of season 13 of American Idol on January 14, 2014 on FOX.\nIn the two new versions, recreated by Schneider, he is shown making the track playing only Coca-Cola bottles, glasses and cans. In addition, \"Feels So Close\" features the vocals of Sam Tsui whereas on the track \"Little Talks\", he is accompanied musically by beatboxing cellist Kevin Olusola. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kurt+Hugo+Schneider\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Fleetwood Mac are a British-American rock band, formed in London in 1967. Fleetwood Mac was founded by guitarist Peter Green, drummer Mick Fleetwood and guitarist Jeremy Spencer, before bassist John McVie joined the lineup for their self-titled debut album. Danny Kirwan joined as a third guitarist in 1968. Keyboardist Christine Perfect (later known as Christine McVie), who contributed as a session musician from the second album, married McVie and joined in 1970.\n\nPrimarily a British blues band, Fleetwood Mac scored a UK number one with \"Albatross\", and had other hits such as the singles \"Oh Well\" and \"Man of the World\". All three guitarists left in succession during the early 1970s, to be replaced by guitarists Bob Welch and Bob Weston and vocalist Dave Walker. By 1974, all three of them had either departed or been dismissed, leaving the band without a male lead vocalist or guitarist. In late 1974, while Fleetwood was scouting studios in Los Angeles, he was introduced to American folk-rock duo Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. Fleetwood Mac soon asked Buckingham to be their new lead guitarist, and Buckingham agreed on condition that Nicks would also join the band.\n\nThe addition of Buckingham and Nicks gave the band a more pop rock sound, and their 1975 self-titled album, Fleetwood Mac, reached No. 1 in the United States. Rumours (1977), Fleetwood Mac's second album after the arrival of Buckingham and Nicks, produced four U.S. Top 10 singles and remained at number one on the American albums chart for 31 weeks. It also reached the top spot in various countries around the world and won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1978. Rumours has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums in history. The band went through personal turmoil while recording the album, as both the romantic partnerships in the band (one being John and Christine McVie, and the other being Buckingham and Nicks) separated while continuing to make music together.\n\nThe band's personnel remained stable through three more studio albums, but by the late 1980s began to disintegrate. After Buckingham and Nicks each left the band, they were replaced by a number of other guitarists and vocalists. A 1993 one-off performance for the first inauguration of Bill Clinton featured the lineup of Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, Nicks, and Buckingham back together for the first time in six years. A full reunion occurred four years later, and the group released their fourth U.S. No. 1 album, The Dance (1997), a live compilation of their hits, also marking the 20th anniversary of Rumours. Christine McVie left the band in 1998, but continued to work with the band in a session capacity. Meanwhile, the group remained together as a four-piece, releasing their most recent studio album, Say You Will, in 2003. Christine McVie rejoined the band full-time in 2014. In 2018, Buckingham was fired from the band and was replaced by Mike Campbell, formerly of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and Neil Finn of Split Enz and Crowded House.\n\nFleetwood Mac has sold more than 120 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling bands. In 1979, the group was honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1998 the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.\n\nDanny Kirwan, guitarist, songwriter and early member of Fleetwood Mac (1968–1972) died in London, England, on 8 June 2018, aged 68. An obituary in The New York Times said he had died in his sleep after contracting pneumonia earlier in the year. The British music magazine Mojo quoted Christine McVie as saying: \"Danny Kirwan was the white English blues guy. Nobody else could play like him. He was a one-off ... Danny and Peter [Green] gelled so well together. Danny had a very precise, piercing vibrato – a unique sound ... He was a perfectionist; a fantastic musician and a fantastic writer.\" One of Kirwan's songs, \"Tell Me All the Things You Do\" from the 1970 album Kiln House, was included in the set of the 2018–19 An Evening with Fleetwood Mac tour.\n\nOn 28 May 2020 Neil Finn, featuring Nicks and McVie, with Campbell on guitar, released the song “Find Your Way Back Home” for the Auckland, New Zealand homeless shelter Auckland City Mission. \n\nFounding member Peter Green died on 25 July 2020 at the age of 73. In October 2020, Rumours again entered the Billboard top 10. The album received 30.6 million plays on streaming platforms the week of October 15, after a TikTok video of the song \"Dreams\" went viral.\n\nOn 30 November 2022, it was announced that  band member Christine McVie died at the age of 79, after a short illness.\n\nOn 18 June 2024, band member Stevie Nicks stated that there would be \"no chance of putting Fleetwood Mac together in anyway\" after the passing of Christine McVie. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Fleetwood+Mac\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970 by Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals), and Roger Taylor (drums, vocals), later joined by John Deacon (bass). Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock, and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly styles by incorporating elements of arena rock and pop rock.\n\nBefore forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band Smile. Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970 and suggested the name \"Queen.\" Deacon was recruited in February 1971, before the band released their self-titled debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, ''Queen II'', in 1974. ''Sheer Heart Attack'' later that year and ''A Night at the Opera'' in 1975 brought them international success. The latter featured \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" which topped the UK Singles Chart for nine weeks and helped popularize the music video format. The band's 1977 album ''News of the World'' contained \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions,\" which have become anthems at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. \"Another One Bites the Dust\" from ''The Game'' (1980) became their best-selling single, and their 1981 compilation album ''Greatest Hits'' is the best-selling album in the UK and is certified 9× Platinum in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Their performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert is ranked among the greatest in rock history by various publications. In August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with Queen at Knebworth, England.\n\nMercury was diagnosed with AIDS in 1987. The band released two more albums, ''The Miracle'' in 1989 and ''Innuendo'' in 1991. On 23 November 1991, Mercury publicly revealed his AIDS diagnosis, and the next day died of bronchopneumonia, a complication of AIDS. One more album was released featuring Mercury's vocals, 1995's ''Made in Heaven''. Deacon retired in 1997, while May and Taylor continued to make sporadic appearances together. Since 2004, they have toured as \"Queen +\", with vocalists Paul Rodgers and Adam Lambert.\n\nQueen have been a global presence in popular culture for more than half a century. Estimates of their record sales range from 250 million to 300 million, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. In 1990, Queen received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.

        "biografia":"Gorillaz is a British virtual band created in 1998 by musician Damon Albarn and artist Jamie Hewlett. The band currently consists of four animated members: Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar) who formed the band, 2-D (lead vocals, keyboards), Noodle (guitar, vocals) and Russel Hobbs (drums and percussion). Their fictional universe is explored through animated music videos, interviews and animated shorts. In reality, Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor and often collaborates with other musicians.\n\nThe roots of Gorillaz can be traced back to 1990, when guitarist Graham Coxon asked cartoonist Jamie Hewlett to interview his newly formed band, Blur. Coxon knew of Hewlett's work drawing the Tank Girl comic strip in Deadline magazine. When Jamie first met the band's lead singer Damon Albarn, the two did not hit it off well. Hewlett initially thought Albarn was \"arsey\" and \"a wanker,\" but the two remained acquainted and would eventually become roommates in 1997, living in London. \n\nBoth  Jamie and Damon tell the story of The Gorillaz' conception same way. They were in their flat watching TV, specifically MTV, and came up with the idea of a \"virtual band\" as commentary on the vapidity of popular music at the turn of the millennium. Previously the best-known '\"cartoon bands\" were The Archies and Josie and the Pussycats, that kids could watch on Saturday mornings. But Gorillaz (initially called just \"Gorilla\") was to be an ambitious musical project with eclectic, genre-bending tunes,  unique visuals, and a detailed backstory for how the virtual band came to be. \n\nWith Gorillaz, Albarn departed from the distinct  Britpop of Blur and explored influences including hip hop, electronic music, and world music through an \"eccentrically postmodern\" approach. The band's 2001 debut album Gorillaz sold over seven million copies worldwide. It was nominated for the Mercury Prize, but the nomination was withdrawn at the band's request. Their second studio album, Demon Days (2005), went six times platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US, and has sold over eight million copies worldwide. The band has won other awards, including one Grammy Award, two MTV Video Music Awards, an NME Award and three MTV Europe Music Awards.\n\nThe third Gorillaz studio album, Plastic Beach, was released in March 2010. The fourth, The Fall, was released in December 2010 as a free download for fan club members, then in April 2011 as a physical release. In 2017, after a five-year hiatus, Gorillaz announced their fifth studio album Humanz. Their sixth studio album, The Now Now, was released on 29 June 2018. Their seventh album, Song Machine, Season 1: Strange Timez, was released in 2020 through a series of episodical music videos. Cracker Island, the band's eighth album, was released on February 24, 2023. Gorillaz have been nominated for ten Brit Awards and won Best British Group at the 2018 Brit Awards.\n\nThe Gorillaz characters only appear in animated form and are not alter-egos of real people, as is often mistakenly assumed. There is an extensive fictional back-story behind these band members, written by Albarn and Hewlett. Their albums, several of their music videos, and their autobiographical book Rise Of The Ogre all tell the saga. Damon Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor to the band, which is also a collaboration between various musicians. Their style is broad with a large number of alternative influences including rock, hip-hop, and electronica.\n\nThey have released eight studio albums: Gorillaz (2001), Demon Days (2005), Plastic Beach (2010), The Fall (Also in 2010), Humanz (2017), The Now Now (2018), Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez (2020), and Cracker Island (2023). Additionally, they have put out two B-side collections, G-Sides (2001) and D-Sides (2007), and a reggae remix of the Gorillaz album entitled Laika Come Home (2002). The band has also released three DVDs: Phase One: Celebrity Takedown, Demon Days: Live at Manchester Opera House, and Phase Two: Slow Boat To Hades. At the end of 2010, Gorillaz released their next album, The Fall, which was recorded during their US 'Escape to Plastic Beach' tour. It is promoted as being the first album made entirely on iPad. The album is streamed on the Gorillaz website. \n\nThe band's first single, Clint Eastwood, was released on 5 March 2001. This single was the first of four from Gorillaz, which was released  on 26 March 2001. The other three singles were released over the next year. These were: 19-2000, Rock the House, and Tomorrow Comes Today. The album sold over 7 million copies worldwide and has gone platinum twice in the United Kingdom earning them an entry in the Guinness Book of Records as the Most Successful Virtual Band. It was nominated for the Mercury Prize, but the nomination was later withdrawn at the band's request. Collaborators on the first album included Del tha Funkee Homosapien (often mistaken for a full-time band member), Miho Hatori (formerly of Cibo Matto), Tina Weymouth of Talking Heads.and Ibrahim Ferrer. The album was produced by Dan the Automator of Deltron 3030.\n\nAt the end of 2001 the band released another single, 911, which was a collaboration between Gorillaz and rap artists D12, Eminem and Terry Hall. The single would find its way onto the soundtrack to the 2002 action comedy Bad Company.\n\nTheir second studio album, Demon Days, was released on 11 May  2005 and included the hit singles Feel Good Inc., DARE, Dirty Harry and Kids With Guns \/ El Mañana. Demon Days went five times platinum in the UK, double platinum in the United States, and earned five Grammy award nominations for 2006 and won one of them (Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals). Collaborators on this album – produced by Dj Danger Mouse – include De La Soul, Bootie Brown of The Pharcyde, Shaun Ryder of the Happy Mondays, Neneh Cherry, Ike Turner, MF Doom, Roots Manuva, and Martina Topley-Bird, among others.  DARE – the first Gorillaz track featuring lead vocals by Noodle – reached #1 in the UK charts.\n\nIn late 2007, Albarn and Hewlett began working on Carousel, a new Gorillaz project which eventually evolved into the band's third studio album, Plastic Beach, which was released 9 March 2010. Albarn said, \"I'm making this one the most pop record I've ever made in many ways, but with all my experience to try and at least present something that has got depth.” The album features guest performances by Snoop Dogg, Lou Reed, Mos Def, Bobby Womack, Gruff Rhys, Mark E. Smith, Mick Jones, Paul Simonon, Bashy,  Kano, De La Soul, Little Dragon, Hypnotic Brass Ensemble, sinfonia ViVA, and The Lebanese National Orchestra for Oriental Arabic Music. \n\nA 3D projection of the group was shown at the 2005 MTV Music Awards and the 2006 Grammys. They also performed at the Brits, in a different format, using screens rather than projections. Gorillaz have performed live in other occasions as well: in 2001 & 2002 they did tours where the musicians played behind screens, and in 2005 & 2006, Gorillaz had five nights in Manchester and New York respectively. This time the screens were behind the musicians, who were visible to the audience only as silhouettes (except for the guest-stars).\n\nSince the band began to achieve mainstream success, there have been rumours of them working on a full-length movie. Some of these have been confirmed, but nothing has gotten beyond planning stages, mainly due to conflicts between the band and studios involved. In 2008, Hewlett said \"Ultimately we didn't think that feel we're in a position to make the kind of movie we want to make with Gorillaz at the moment. [...] But I'd still like to make a full, lavishly-animated Gorillaz movie someday.\"\n\nAlbarn and Hewlett created a Pop Opera called Monkey: Journey to the West, which premiered in the summer of 2007 at the Manchester International Festival. A soundtrack album was recorded in the summer as well (initially only digitally available though a CD version was released in 2008). The production went on to show at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris in September-October 2007, the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, SC, USA in May 2008, and the Royal Opera House in London in July 2008.\n\nThe duo behind the Pop Opera built on ideas from Monkey: Journey to the West to release a short film in the Summer of 2008 which accompanied the United Kingdom's coverage of the BBC Olympic Coverage in Beijing. It featured a basic outline of the main plot elements of the Opera, reworked into a \"Journey to the East\", with the characters finishing in the Beijing Olympic Stadium. \n\nGorillaz headlined the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury 2010, as an immediate replacement for U2, who dropped out of performing at the festival.\n\nAt the end of 2010 Gorillaz released their next album The Fall made in the hotel rooms during their US tour. It was, when released, the first album to be recorded entirely on an iPad. The album was made available for free to Gorillaz fan club members for a limited time as a digital download – and hard copies were released to worldwide markets in the following year.\n\nIn April 2012, Albarn told The Guardian that he and Hewlett had fallen out and that future Gorillaz projects were \"unlikely\".  However, it was later announced by the duo that they had reconciled their difference – and that Noodle, Russel, Murdoc and 2-D would return with a new album in 2017.  Featuring collaborations by artists such as album Grace Jones, Kali Uchis, Popcaan, Vince Staples, Mavis Staples, Peven Everett, Pusha T, Kelela, Jamie Principle, D.R.A.M. and Graham Coxon, Humanz was released to critical acclaim; the album would go on to win Gorillaz the 2018 Brit Award for Best British Group.  Gorillaz would also collaborate with Carly Simon, Kilo Kish and Rag'n'Bone Man on the Deluxe edition of Humanz, while Little Simz would feature on the single Garage Palace.  Another 2017 release was the single Sleeping Powder – supposedly written and recorded in a day.  Meanwhile, a solar energy-themed collaboration with E.ON, released in 2017, would later win Gorillaz a Webby Award.  \n\nA new album, The Now Now, would follow in 2018.  Written by Albarn whilst touring Humanz – and featuring two collaborations, including the return of Snoop Dogg and Jamie Principle as well as George Benson and Graham Coxon – The Now Now spawned six singles, including Humility, Tranz, and Lake Zürich.  Murdoc was unable to enjoy the band's success for the time being as he was undergoing a stint in jail for an undisclosed malefaction; he was replaced on bass for Ace Copular – who most famously played Ace of the Gangreen Gang in the Powerpuff Girls TV series – for the recording of The Now Now; however, Murdoc would later break his way out of prison.  Gorillaz saw the year out by securing another Brits nomination for Best British Group as well as winning a second consecutive Webby Award; this time, for the FreeMurdoc chatbot, which provided a way for Gorillaz fans to interact with Murdoc Niccals during his incarceration.\n\nGorillaz announced that their ninth studio album पर्वत  (The Mountain) is scheduled for release on February 27, 2026.\n\nIn March 2013 they became the best-selling virtual band of all time. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Gorillaz\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The trio's first single 'A Calf Born In Winter' was released in May 2014 by Late Night Tales offshoot Night Time Stories, and saw support from DJs Zane Lowe, Cerys Matthews, Tom Ravenscroft, Gideon Coe and magazines as musically diverse as Test Pressing, For Folks Sake, i-D, The 405 and Ransom Note. 'The Infamous Bill' is an expanded offering of Khruangbin's exotic, individual sound. The EP's four tracks were recorded at their spritual home, a remote barn deep in the Texas countryside where Khruangbin's first rehearsals took place. Taking influence from 1960's Thai funk - Khruangbin literally translates to \"Engine Fly\" in Thai - the EP is steeped in the bass heavy, psychedelic sound of their inspiration, Tarantino soundtracks and surf-rock cool.\n\nMark and DJ's roots are in R&B, hip hop and gospel having played within the same gospel band for years. Both professional musicians, Mark began teaching Laura how to play bass in the summer of 2009. As such, Laura quickly developed a huge passion for the instrument and the aesthetic it brought to music she loved. Having worked studiously on developing her skills, both Mark and Laura were invited to tour with Ninja Tune's YPPAH supporting Bonobo across his 2010 American tour. The tour galvanised the two of them to start making music together more seriously, sowing the first seeds of Khruangbin, with DJ the natural go to for drums. Having kept in touch, Bonobo included Khruangbin's 'A Calf Born In Winter' on his 2013 'Late Night Tales' compilation. In addition to increasing the Stateside following the band has built, the release has helped Khruangbin in topping both the US & UK 'Last FM' fastest growing artists whilst 'A Calf Born In Winter' continues to be one of the most popular single downloads from the compilation. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Khruangbin\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

They've been on an indefinite hiatus since 2024.\n\n\nMembers:\nVocals: Damiano David\nGuitar: Thomas Raggi\nBass: Victoria De Angelis (also backing vocals from 2023 to 2024)\nDrums, Percussion: Ethan Torchio (also guitars from 2023 to 2024)\n\n\nBiography:\nThe band is composed of lead vocalist Damiano David, bassist Victoria De Angelis, guitarist Thomas Raggi, and drummer Ethan Torchio. Performing in the streets in their early days, Måneskin rose to prominence after coming in second in the eleventh season of the Italian version of X Factor in 2017, where they were coached by Manuel Agnelli. Their international breakthrough occurred when the foursome won the Eurovision Song Contest 2021 for Italy with the song \"Zitti e buoni\".\n\nMåneskin has released three studio albums, Il ballo della vita (2018), Teatro d'ira: Vol. I (2021), and Rush! (2023), plus an extended play Chosen (2017), and 13 singles, which have topped Italian and European music charts. They have received 34 platinum and seven gold certifications from FIMI, and had sold over a million records in Italy before their post-Eurovision breakthrough. Previously, the band's most successful Italian single was \"Torna a casa\". In 2021, Måneskin became the first Italian rock band to reach the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart, with the songs \"Zitti e buoni\", \"I Wanna Be Your Slave\" and a cover of The Four Seasons' \"Beggin'\" reaching the top 10 on the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. chart, receiving multiple international certifications for sales of over three million copies internationally, and four million in total. They received their first Grammy nomination in the Best New Artist category at the 2023 Grammy Awards.\n\nAs of 2022, Måneskin have sold an estimated 40 million copies worldwide and garnered four billion streams across all streaming platforms, and six diamond, 133 platinum, and 34 gold certifications.\n\n2015–2016: Formation\nMembers Damiano David, Victoria De Angelis, and Thomas Raggi first met each other as students during their high school days in Rome, with Ethan Torchio from nearby Frosinone soon joining them when they inquired on Facebook in a \"Musicians Wanted\" advert for a drummer to complete the line-up. Although the band's origins can be traced to 2015, it was officially formed in 2016 when the members had to choose the band's name because they had decided to register for Pulse, a local music contest for emerging bands. While brainstorming, De Angelis, who is half Danish, was asked by her bandmates to toss out some Danish words, and they agreed on Måneskin ('moonlight'), although its meaning is not related to the band itself. The Pulse contest also marked a turning point in their career, since they had to start writing their own songs. The competition led them to perform at the Felt music club & school in front of 200–300 people, and they later went on to win first prize.\n\nThey later performed as buskers in the streets of the Colli Portuensi district of Rome, as well as in the historical centre of Rome, including in Via del Corso. One of their first live concerts outside their native city took place in Faenza, at the 2016 Meeting of Independent Record Labels. Approximately 33 people attended the show. After a trip to Denmark, during which the band also performed some live shows, Måneskin strengthened their cohesiveness, and started to play together for several hours a day.\n\n2017–2019: X Factor and Il ballo della vita\nIn 2017, they took part in the eleventh season of the Italian talent show X Factor, under the guidance of mentor Manuel Agnelli, finishing in second place behind Lorenzo Licitra. There they covered \"Beggin'\" by the Four Seasons, \"Take Me Out\" by Franz Ferdinand, and \"Somebody Told Me\" by the Killers, among others. The original song they performed during the show, \"Chosen\", was released as a single on 24 November 2017 by Sony Music and charted at number two on the Italian FIMI Singles Chart. It was included in the extended play of the same title, released in mid-December 2017 and mainly consisting of covers previously performed during the X Factor live shows. The EP was later certified double platinum by FIMI.\n\nOn 23 March 2018, the band released their first Italian-language single, \"Morirò da re\", which continued their commercial success. Måneskin's first full-length studio album, featuring \"Morirò da re\" and preceded by the ballad single \"Torna a casa\", was released on 26 October 2018. Both the album, titled Il ballo della vita, and the single \"Torna a casa\" topped the charts in Italy. To promote the album, the band theatrically released a documentary film, titled This Is Måneskin. The film premiered in Italy on 26 October 2018.\n\nIn January 2019, the band released their fourth single \"Fear for Nobody\", while in April 2019 their fifth single \"L'altra dimensione\" rose to fourth on the FIMI Singles Chart. Their sixth single \"Le parole lontane\", which was released in September 2019, reached top 5 of the FIMI Singles Chart and was certified platinum. During their first tour, held between 2018 and 2019, they sold-out over 70 dates along with selling more than 140,000 tickets, a figure that also included their first European tour with eleven sold-out dates in Spain, France, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and the United Kingdom.\n\n2020–2021: Teatro d'ira: Vol. I, Eurovision and global recognition\nFrom late 2019 until spring 2020, the band lived in London where they worked on their music style and new material. In October 2020, their seventh single \"Vent'anni\" was released. On 6 March 2021, the band won the Sanremo Music Festival 2021 with the song \"Zitti e buoni\", ahead of runners-up Francesca Michielin and Fedez, and Ermal Meta. Their win was viewed by many to be a surprise, as rock is considered an atypical contesting music genre in the history of the Festival. Prior to Sanremo, the band announced their second studio album Teatro d'ira: Vol. I, which was released on 19 March 2021.\n\nAs the winners of Sanremo 2021, Måneskin was designated as the Italian representatives at the Eurovision Song Contest 2021, held in Rotterdam, Netherlands, with \"Zitti e buoni\". On 15 May, Italy climbed to the top of the betting odds to win the contest, surpassing competitors from France, Switzerland and Malta, all of whom had occupied the top spot at one point between the release date of their songs and the night of the grand final. On 22 May, the band confirmed the predictions by going on to win the contest with an energetic performance, having received a total of 524 points, thus giving Italy its third Eurovision triumph after Gigliola Cinquetti in 1964 and Toto Cutugno in 1990. Måneskin also became the first band and \"Zitti e buoni\" the first rock song to win the contest since Lordi with \"Hard Rock Hallelujah\" for Finland in 2006. Upon accepting the winner's trophy, Damiano shouted into the microphone: \"We just want to say to the whole of Europe, to the whole world. Rock and Roll never dies!\"\n\nAfter the contest, the album Teatro d'ira: Vol. I, its single \"Zitti e buoni\", tracks \"I Wanna Be Your Slave\" and \"Coraline\", as well as other releases from the band entered weekly charts across Europe and beyond, including several Spotify global charts. \"Zitti e buoni\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Slave\" also entered the top ten of the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. chart. \"Zitti e buoni\" also became the first Italian-language song in 30 years to chart on the top 20 of the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 17, as well as \"I Wanna Be Your Slave\" peaking at number five, which was the first song by an Italian rock band to reach the UK top ten, thus making the band the first Eurovision winners since Celine Dion to have two songs in the UK top 40, and a top 10 hit with a non-contest song. Their 2017 cover of the Four Seasons \"Beggin'\" also peaked at number six, thus making them the first Italian act and the first Eurovision-associated act to have two songs charting in the top ten of the UK Singles Chart at the same time. \"Beggin'\" later debuted on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 78 and went on to peak at number 13, making them the second Eurovision-winning act in recent history to break into the chart.\n\nThe band went on a European promotional tour between June and July, and performed at a number of open-air summer music festivals in 2021, including Rock for People and Nova Rock Festival. A live recording of \"Beggin'\", recorded at Ronquières Festival 2021, was released as a digital single on 27 September 2021. The band's tenth single \"Mammamia\" was released on 8 October. On 26 October, they made their US television debut performing \"Beggin'\" on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and later in November performed on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the MTV Europe Music Awards where they won the award for Best Rock act, and at the American Music Awards. During this period, they also held a sold-out London concert at the O2 Academy Islington, sold-out US concerts at the Roxy Theatre and Bowery Ballroom, and opened for the Rolling Stones at Las Vegas' Allegiant Stadium.\n\n2022–2024: Rush!\nOn 22 January 2022, Måneskin was the musical guest on Saturday Night Live. The band's eleventh single \"Supermodel\" was released on 13 May, and was performed at the final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2022, held in Turin the following day. They also performed a short rendition of \"If I Can Dream\" which was later included in the soundtrack of the film Elvis. The band performed \"Supermodel\" with Jimmy Fallon subbing for an ill DeAngelis on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on 20 May, and at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards (where the band won the Best Alternative Video category for \"I Wanna Be Your Slave\") on 28 August. Måneskin embarked on the Loud Kids Tour Gets Louder, which visited Japan, the Americas, and Europe between fall 2022 and summer 2023.\n\nTheir twelfth single \"The Loneliest\" was released on 7 October, and won on 12 September 2023 for Best Rock Video at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards. The band's third studio album, Rush!, was released on 20 January 2023. They were nominated for the Best New Artist category for the 65th Annual Grammy Awards, but lost to jazz singer Samara Joy. \"La fine\" was released as a promotional single from Rush! on 16 December. On 13 January 2023, the band released the single and music video for \"Gossip\", featuring Tom Morello. In February 2023, Variety ran a profile piece on Måneskin, referring to them as \"the biggest rock band to emerge in years\", and The New York Times followed with its own profile that September, calling them \"almost certainly the biggest Italian rock band of all time.\"\n\nThe band made their debut at the Glastonbury Festival in June 2023, followed by the Rush! World Tour, which visited Europe, the Americas, Oceania and Asia from September to December 2023. On 1 September, they released the single \"Honey (Are U Coming?)\", which was later included in Rush! (Are U Coming?), a reissue of Rush! that was released on 10 November.\n\n2024-present: Indefinite hiatus and solo projects\nIn July 2024 they released the Japan exclusive live album \"LIVE IN JAPAN -RUSH! WORLD TOUR-\" before the band confirmed that they are going on hiatus.\nMeanwhile the band members have been active as solo artists:\n\nVictoria has been pursuing a career as a DJ and released singles such as \"WHISTLE\" and \"T-Shirt\".\n\nDamiano David has released his solo album \"Funny Little Fears\" which was later re-released as \"FUNNY little DREAMS\". He also toured the world solo.\n\nGuitarist Thomas Raggi released his first solo album \"MASQUERADE\" in December 2025 featuring artists like Tom Morello, Franz Ferdinand and Kasabian.\n\n\nMusical style and influences:\nAccording to Damiano David, the group is \"a translation of the music of the past into modernity\". Måneskin's music has been classified as pop rock, alternative rock, glam rock, hard rock and funk rock. Their music style changed from a pop rock sound with funk influences on their first studio album to hard rock on their second studio album, as heard in \"Zitti e buoni\". Their look and sound have been compared to 1970s rock music. The band members have cited various musical and fashion influences, including Led Zeppelin, Fleetwood Mac, Nirvana, Perry Farrell, Radiohead, Franz Ferdinand, David Bowie, Aerosmith, Black Sabbath, Gentle Giant, the Rolling Stones, the Doors, Arctic Monkeys, Red Hot Chili Peppers, IDLES, Harry Styles, Bruno Mars, R.E.M. and Italian rock bands Marlene Kuntz, Verdena and Afterhours.\n\n\nDiscography:\nAlbums\n2018.10.26 - Il ballo della vita\n2021.03.19 - Teatro d’ira Vol. I (later re-released as Japan Tour Edition)\n2023.01.20 - RUSH!\n2023.11.10 - RUSH!

        "biografia":"Mumford & Sons are an English folk rock band formed in London, United Kingdom in 2007. The band consists of Marcus Mumford (lead vocals, electric guitar, acoustic guitar, drums), Ben Lovett (vocals, keyboards, piano), and Ted Dwane (vocals, bass guitar, double bass). Banjo player Winston Marshall left the band in 2021. \n\nMumford & Sons have released four studio albums: Sigh No More (2009), Babel (2012), Wilder Mind (2015), and Delta (2018). Sigh No More peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart and the Billboard 200 in the US, with Babel and Wilder Mind both debuting at number one in the UK and US, the former becoming the fastest-selling rock album of the decade and leading to a headline performance at Glastonbury Festival in 2013. The band have also issued two live albums: Live at Shepherd's Bush Empire (2011) and The Road to Red Rocks (2012).\n\nMumford & Sons were formed in December 2007 by multi-instrumentalists Marcus Mumford, Ben Lovett, Winston Marshall and Ted Dwane. Band members play acoustic guitar, drums, keyboard instruments, bass guitar, and traditional folk instruments such as banjo, mandolin and resonator guitar. The band name originates from the fact that Marcus Mumford was the most visible member, organising the band and their performances. Lovett indicated that the name was meant to invoke the sense of an \"antiquated family business name\".\n\nA handful of similar bands were increasing their visibility in West London around the same time, giving rise to the label \"West London folk scene\". Mumford downplays that characterise as an exaggeration - Mumford & Sons and a few other folk acts just happened to be operating in the same general area at the time. In an interview with the Herald Sun, Marcus Mumford said, \"It's not folk really. Well, some of it is, and it's certainly not a scene. Someone got over-excited about a few bands who live in a hundred-mile radius and put it in a box to sell it as a package. It's a community, not a scene. It's not exclusive.\" Having developed in the same musical and cultural environment, Mumford & Sons' sound has been compared to that of artists such as Noah and the Whale, Johnny Flynn and Laura Marling, whose backing band had included Marshall, Mumford, and Dwane.\n\nIn early 2008 the band began working with manager Adam Tudhope, who, as part of management company Everybody's, also represents Keane and Laura Marling. It was through Tudhope's connection that Mumford & Sons were exposed to their future A&R at Island, Louis Bloom, who began monitoring the band. Bloom told HitQuarters that they were still at a fledgling state and not yet ready for a label deal: \"There was no one there for it, just a few friends, and they needed time to develop. Over the next six months I kept going to see them and they were literally picking up fans every time.\"\n\nIn February 2008, the band completed an extensive UK tour with support from Alessi's Ark, Sons of Noel and Adrian, Peggy Sue and others. June 2008 marked the band's first appearance at the Glastonbury Festival. They also toured Australia with Laura Marling, whose disinclination to interact with audiences encouraged Mumford into the spotlight. The experience helped inform his attitude towards Mumford & Sons audiences, which is to interact frequently and to try to create a comfortable, casual atmosphere. Mumford & Sons' first project was an EP entitled Love Your Ground which took a year to complete and was released in November 2008 on Chess Club Records.\n\nThe band began by using bluegrass and folk instrumentation, with the core instruments of acoustic guitar, banjo, piano and a double bass, played with a rhythmic style based in alternative rock and folk. In the documentary Big Easy Express, Marcus Mumford recognises the Old Crow Medicine Show influence: \"I first heard Old Crow’s music when I was, like, 16, 17, and that really got me into, like, folk music, bluegrass. I mean, I’d listened to a lot of Dylan, but I hadn’t really ventured into the country world so much. So Old Crow were the band that made me fall in love with country music.\" Mumford acknowledges that \"the band inspired them to pick up the banjo and start their now famous country nights in London.\" Ketch Secor, Old Crow front-man, concurs: \"Those boys took the message and ran with it.\n\nMuch of Mumford & Sons' lyrical content has a strong literary influence, their debut album's name deriving from William Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing. The track \"Sigh No More\" includes lines from the play such as Serve God love me and mend, For man is a giddy thing, and One foot in sea and one on shore. The title of the song \"Roll Away Your Stone\" is an allusion to Macbeth; the song includes the line Stars hide your fires\/ And these here are my desires which borrows and pares down Macbeth's line in act 1, scene 4: Stars, hide your fires,\/ Let not light see my black and deep desires. Additionally, \"The Cave\" includes several references to The Odyssey, in particular the sirens that Odysseus encounters on his journey home. The song also contains many references to G.K. Chesterton's book, St. Francis of Assisi, in which Chesterton uses Plato's Cave as a way of explaining how St. Francis views the world from God's perspective. \"Little Lion Man\" appears to be a retelling in dramatic monologue form of Chretien de Troyes' Yvain, the Knight of the Lion, which is the story of a knight who goes mad after betraying a promise to his wife to return to her. Both \"Timshel\" and \"Dust Bowl Dance\" draw heavily from the John Steinbeck novels Of Mice and Men, East of Eden and The Grapes of Wrath.\n\nThe band's change in sound on their third album was described by Lovett as a \"natural departure.\" At the end of the Babel tour Winston Marshall traded his banjo for electric guitar in sound checks and Mumford started playing more drums as the band jammed on heavy instrumentals and even some Radiohead tunes. Banjo does not feature on the record, an instrument that had become synonymous with the band. NME reported that the band's sound is \"More expansive than ever and decidedly heavier, thanks to the shift in instrumentation.\" The group also employed a full drumkit instead of kick drum. \"We've had our standard line-up of instruments for the last six years and we felt like that was our palette, [but] we started picking up other stuff,\" said Lovett. \"It's a very natural departure from some of that rootsier stuff.\"\n\nLovett told NME that working with James Ford for Wilder Mind was part of trying something new. \"We felt a need for change. Not from Markus [Dravs], but he was so closely attached to those first two records that as we had taken that time off, we wanted to try doing something new. It felt like, if we do our third record with Markus, does that mean we do our ninth and 10th records with Markus? At some point you have to try different things, as we collectively felt like it was time to try other stuff. Markus knows that we might well make the next record with him. We definitely haven't broken up [with Dravs], we're just playing the field!\".\n\nThe band have won a number of music awards throughout their career, with Sigh No More earning the band the Brit Award for Best British Album in 2011 and six overall Grammy Award nominations. The live performance at the 2011 Grammy ceremony with Bob Dylan and The Avett Brothers led to a surge in popularity for the band in the US. The band received eight total Grammy nominations for Babel and won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. The band also won the Brit Award for Best British Group in 2013. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Mumford+&+Sons\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"David Robert Jones (8 January 1947 – 10 January 2016), known professionally as David Bowie, was an English singer-songwriter and actor. A leading figure in the music industry, he is regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. Bowie was acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, and his music and stagecraft had a significant impact on popular music.\n\nBowie developed an interest in music from an early age. He studied art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. \"Space Oddity\", released in 1969, was his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of Bowie's single \"Starman\" and album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted towards a sound he characterised as \"plastic soul\", initially alienating many of his UK fans but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the album Young Americans. In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film The Man Who Fell to Earth and released Station to Station. In 1977, he again changed direction with the electronic-inflected album Low, the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the \"Berlin Trilogy\". \"Heroes\" (1977) and Lodger (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.\n\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had three number-one hits: the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and \"Under Pressure\" (a 1981 collaboration with Queen). He achieved massive commercial success in the 1980s starting with Let's Dance (1983). Between 1988 and 1992, he fronted the hard rock band Tin Machine before resuming his solo career in 1993. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including industrial and jungle. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (1983), Jareth the Goblin King in Labyrinth (1986), Pontius Pilate in The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), and Nikola Tesla in The Prestige (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with The Next Day. He remained musically active until his death from liver cancer at his home in New York City. He died two days after both his 69th birthday and the release of his final album, Blackstar (2016).\n\nDuring his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100 million records worldwide, made him one of the best-selling musicians of all time. In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum, eleven gold and eight silver album certifications, and released 11 number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Rolling Stone ranked him among the greatest artists in history. As of 2022, Bowie was the best-selling vinyl artist of the 21st century.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/David_Bowie\n\nStudio albums\nDavid Bowie (1967)\nDavid Bowie\/Space Oddity (1969)\nThe Man Who Sold the World (1970)\nHunky Dory (1971)\nThe Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972)\nAladdin Sane (1973)\nPin Ups (1973)\nDiamond Dogs (1974)\nYoung Americans (1975)\nStation to Station (1976)\nLow (1977)\n\"Heroes\" (1977)\nLodger (1979)\nScary Monsters (and Super Creeps) (1980)\nLet's Dance (1983)\nTonight (1984)\nNever Let Me Down (1987)\nBlack Tie White Noise (1993)\nThe Buddha of Suburbia (1993)\nOutside (1995)\nEarthling (1997)\nHours (1999)\nHeathen (2002)\nReality (2003)\nThe Next Day (2013)\nBlackstar (2016) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/David+Bowie\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Sir James Paul McCartney CH MBE (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer, songwriter, musician, and record and film producer who gained worldwide fame as co-lead vocalist and bassist for the Beatles. His songwriting partnership with John Lennon remains the most successful in history. After the group disbanded in 1970, he pursued a solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine.\n\nA self-taught musician, McCartney is proficient on bass, guitar, keyboards, and drums. He is known for his melodic approach to bass-playing (mainly playing with a plectrum), his versatile and wide tenor vocal range (spanning over four octaves), and his eclecticism (exploring styles ranging from pre-rock and roll pop to classical and electronica). McCartney began his career as a member of the Quarrymen in 1957, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Starting with the 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, he gradually became the Beatles' de facto leader, providing the creative impetus for most of their music and film projects. His Beatles songs \"And I Love Her\" (1964), \"Yesterday\" (1965), \"Eleanor Rigby\" (1966), and \"Blackbird\" (1968) rank among the most covered songs in history.\n\nIn 1970, McCartney debuted as a solo artist with the album McCartney. Throughout the 1970s, he led Wings, one of the most successful bands of the decade, with more than a dozen international top 10 singles and albums. McCartney resumed his solo career in 1980. Since 1989, he has toured consistently as a solo artist. In 1993, he formed the music duo the Fireman with Youth of Killing Joke. Beyond music, he has taken part in projects to promote international charities related to such subjects as animal rights, seal hunting, land mines, vegetarianism, poverty, and music education.\n\nMcCartney is one of the most successful composers and performers of all time. He has written or co-written 32 songs that have reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, and as of 2009, had sales of 25.5 million RIAA-certified units in the United States. His honours include two inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1999), 18 Grammy Awards, an appointment as a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1965, and a knighthood in 1997 for services to music. As of 2020, he is also one of the wealthiest musicians in the world, with an estimated fortune of £800 million.\n\nBest known for primarily using a plectrum or pick, McCartney occasionally plays fingerstyle. He was strongly influenced by Motown artists, in particular James Jamerson, whom McCartney called a hero for his melodic style. He was also influenced by Brian Wilson, as he commented: \"because he went to very unusual places\". Another favourite bassist of his is Stanley Clarke. McCartney's skill as a bass player has been acknowledged by bassists including Sting, Dr. Dre bassist Mike Elizondo, and Colin Moulding of XTC.\n\nDuring McCartney's early years with the Beatles, he primarily used a Höfner 500\/1 bass, although from 1965, he favoured his Rickenbacker 4001S for recording. While typically using Vox amplifiers, by 1967, he had also begun using a Fender Bassman for amplification. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he used a Wal 5-String, which he said made him play more thick-sounding basslines, in contrast to the much lighter Höfner, which inspired him to play more sensitively, something he considers fundamental to his playing style. He changed back to the Höfner around 1990 for that reason. He uses Mesa Boogie bass amplifiers while performing live.\n\nMcCartney was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 as a member of the Beatles and again as a solo artist in 1999. In 1979, the Guinness Book of World Records recognised McCartney as the \"most honored composer and performer in music\", with 60 gold discs (43 with the Beatles, 17 with Wings) and, as a member of the Beatles, sales of over 100 million singles and 100 million albums, and as the \"most successful song writer\", he wrote jointly or solo 43 songs which sold one million or more records between 1962 and 1978. In 2009, Guinness World Records again recognised McCartney as the \"most successful songwriter\" having written or co-written 188 charted records in the United Kingdom, of which 91 reached the top 10 and 33 made it to number one.\n\nMcCartney has written, or co-written, 32 number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100: twenty with the Beatles; seven solo or with Wings; one as a co-writer of \"A World Without Love\", a number-one single for Peter and Gordon; one as a co-writer on Elton John's cover of \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\"; one as a co-writer on Stars on 45's \"Medley\"; one as a co-writer with Michael Jackson on \"Say Say Say\"; and one as writer on \"Ebony and Ivory\" performed with Stevie Wonder. As of 2009, he has 15.5 million RIAA certified units in the United States as a solo artist plus another 10 million with Wings.\n\nCredited with more number ones in the UK than any other artist, McCartney has participated in twenty-four chart topping singles: seventeen with the Beatles, one solo, and one each with Wings, Stevie Wonder, Ferry Aid, Band Aid, Band Aid 20 and \"The Christians et al.\" He is the only artist to reach the UK number one as a soloist (\"Pipes of Peace\"), duo (\"Ebony and Ivory\" with Wonder), trio (\"Mull of Kintyre\", Wings), quartet (\"She Loves You\", the Beatles), quintet (\"Get Back\", the Beatles with Billy Preston) and as part of a musical ensemble for charity (Ferry Aid).\n\n\"Yesterday\" is one of the most covered songs in history with more than 2,200 recorded versions, and according to the BBC, \"the track is the only one by a UK writer to have been aired more than seven million times on American TV and radio and is third in the all-time list … is the most played song by a British writer century in the US\". His 1968 Beatles composition \"Hey Jude\" achieved the highest sales in the UK that year and topped the US charts for nine weeks, which is longer than any other Beatles single. It was also the longest single released by the band and, at seven minutes eleven seconds, was at that time the longest number one. \"Hey Jude\" is the best-selling Beatles single, achieving sales of over five million copies soon after its release.\n\nIn July 2005, McCartney's performance of \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" with U2 at Live 8 became the fastest-released single in history. Available within forty-five minutes of its recording, hours later it had achieved number one on the UK Official Download Chart.\n\nIn December 2020, the release of his album McCartney III and its subsequent charting at number 2 on the US Billboard 200 earned McCartney the feat of being the first artist to have a new album in the top two chart positions in each of the last six decades. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Paul+McCartney\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Eric Patrick Clapton CBE (born 30 March 1945) is an English rock and blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter. He is regarded as one of the most successful and influential guitarists in rock music. He ranked second in Rolling Stone's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" and fourth in Gibson's \"Top 50 Guitarists of All Time\". In 2023, Rolling Stone named Clapton the 35th best guitarist of all time. He was also named number five in Time magazine's list of \"The 10 Best Electric Guitar Players\" in 2009.\n\nAfter playing in a number of different local bands, Clapton joined the Yardbirds from 1963 to 1965, and John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers from 1965 to 1966. After leaving Mayall, he formed the power trio Cream with drummer Ginger Baker and bassist\/vocalist Jack Bruce, in which Clapton played sustained blues improvisations and \"arty, blues-based psychedelic pop\". After four successful albums, Cream broke up in November 1968. Clapton then formed the blues rock band Blind Faith with Baker, Steve Winwood, and Ric Grech, recording one album and performing on one tour before they broke up. Clapton then toured with Delaney & Bonnie and recorded his first solo album in 1970, before forming Derek and the Dominos with Bobby Whitlock, Carl Radle and Jim Gordon. Like Blind Faith, the band only lasted one album, Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs, which includes \"Layla\", one of Clapton's signature songs.\n\nClapton continued to record a number of successful solo albums and songs over the next several decades, including a 1974 cover of Bob Marley's \"I Shot the Sheriff\" (which helped reggae reach a mass market), the country-infused Slowhand album (1977) and the pop rock of 1986's August. Following the death of his son Conor in 1991, Clapton's grief was expressed in the song \"Tears in Heaven\", which appeared on his Unplugged album. In 1996 he had another top-40 hit with the R&B crossover \"Change the World\". In 1998, he released the Grammy award-winning \"My Father's Eyes\". Since 1999, he has recorded a number of traditional blues and blues rock albums and hosted the periodic Crossroads Guitar Festival. His most recent studio album is Happy Xmas (2018).\n\nClapton has received 18 Grammy Awards as well as the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In 2004, he was awarded a CBE for services to music. He has received four Ivor Novello Awards from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors, including the Lifetime Achievement Award. He is the only three-time inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: once as a solo artist, and separately as a member of the Yardbirds and of Cream. In his solo career, he has sold more than 280 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling musicians of all time. In 1998, Clapton, a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, founded the Crossroads Centre on Antigua, a medical facility for those recovering from substance abuse. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Eric+Clapton\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Together they have performed across multiple continents and sold over 3.5 million records worldwide.\n\nThey were signed to Lava Records in March 2017 and a month later the band released their debut studio EP, \"Black Smoke Rising\". Their debut single, \"Highway Tune\", topped the Billboard US Mainstream Rock and Active Rock Rock stations in September 2017 for four weeks in a row. A second EP  \"From the Fires\", containing the four songs from Black Smoke Rising and four new songs, was released on November 10, 2017, alongside a second single, \"Safari Song\". \n\nGRETA VAN FLEET's debut LP,  \"Anthem Of The Peaceful Army\", was released in 2018 to countless accolades including No. 1 Billboard Rock Album and Top 3 on the Billboard 200. Their \"From The Fires\" EP, released in 2017, won \"Best Rock Album\" at the 61st Grammy Awards.\n\nTheir 3rd studio album, \"Starcatcher\" (2023) follows GRETA VAN FLEET's second  album  \"The Battle At Garden's Gate\", released in 2021 to extensive chart and critical success. In the US, the album debuted at No. 1 Billboard Rock Album, No. 1 Billboard Hard Rock Album, No. 1 Billboard Vinyl Album, No. 2 Billboard Top Album Sales and in the Top 10 on the Billboard 200. It was a Top 10 album in the U.K. and a major hit around the world.\n\nGRETA VAN FLEET is best known for its renowned live performances, selling over one million tickets worldwide. They sold out their entire 2022 arena tour, holding a special energy between them and their devoted fans. With \"Starcatcher\" the band aims to capture that energy in the recording studio.\n\nThe band's heavy rock sound is influenced by the work of Led Zeppelin and many other rock and blues acts, with lead vocalist Josh Kiszka having a voice that has been compared to Robert Plant's \"husky howl.\n\nGreta Van Fleet's music has been categorized as hard rock and blues rock. Although all four members bonded over blues, each does have their own music tastes; Jake gravitates towards rock and roll, Sam likes jazz, Danny prefers folk, and Josh likes world music. Sam stated that \"It's not like we set out to be a rock and roll band, it's just that sound that comes out [when] we get together and play.\" Songwriting is done by the band as a whole after one of the four members finds the concept for a song. Danny said a lot of their songs are first written in a \"folk set up\" before evolving into something else.\n\nGreta Van Fleet are often compared to Led Zeppelin. Jake related that he \"... went through a year of really intensely studying what [Jimmy] Page did ...\", but he has studied other virtuoso rock guitarists in a similar manner, specifically mentioning Pete Townshend. Likewise, on his voice being compared to Robert Plant's, Josh said that Plant has certainly been an influence, \"though it's not what I was going for.\" Stating that he did not even know who Led Zeppelin was until high school, he explained that his singing style came out naturally one day while struggling to be heard over the rest of the band. In a March 2018 interview, Plant cited Greta Van Fleet as one of his favorite young bands, saying \"they are Led Zeppelin I\" and describing Josh as \"a beautiful little singer.\"\n\nSome of Jake's guitar influences include John Lee Hooker, Elmore James, Bert Jansch, Eric Clapton and Keith Richards. Some of the drummers that inspired Danny are Carmine Appice, John Bonham, Mitch Mitchell and Michael Shrieve.

        "biografia":"Panic! at the Disco was an American pop rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2004 by childhood friends Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith, Brent Wilson, and Brendon Urie. Following several lineup changes, Panic! began operating as the solo project of frontman Urie from 2015 until the project's discontinuation in 2023.\n\nPanic! at the Disco recorded their first demos while they were in high school. Shortly after, the band recorded and released their debut studio album, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out (2005). Popularized by the second single, \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\", the album was certified triple platinum in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker. The band's second album, Pretty. Odd. (2008), was preceded by the single \"Nine in the Afternoon\". That album marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut. In 2009, Ross and Walker formed a new band, the Young Veins, leaving Urie and Smith as the sole remaining members of Panic! at the Disco.\n\nContinuing as a duo, Urie and Smith released a new single, \"New Perspective\", for the movie Jennifer's Body, and recruited bassist Dallon Weekes and guitarist Ian Crawford as touring musicians for live performances. Weekes was later inducted into the band's lineup as a full-time member in 2010. The band's third studio album, Vices & Virtues (2011), was recorded solely by Urie and Smith in 2010, produced by John Feldmann and Butch Walker. Crawford departed once the tour cycle for Vices & Virtues ended in 2012.\n\nAs a three-piece, Urie, Smith, and Weekes recorded and released the band's fourth studio album, Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!, in 2013. Prior to the release of the album, Smith unofficially left the band due to health and drug-related issues, leaving Urie and Weekes as the remaining members. The duo recruited guitarist Kenneth Harris and drummer Dan Pawlovich as touring musicians for live performances.\n\nIn 2015, Smith officially left the band after not performing live with them since his departure in 2013. Shortly thereafter, Weekes reverted to being a touring member once again, resulting in Panic! becoming Urie's solo project. In April 2015, \"Hallelujah\" was released as the first single from Panic! at the Disco's fifth studio album, Death of a Bachelor (2016). In December 2017, Weekes officially announced his departure from the band. In March 2018, Panic! at the Disco released \"Say Amen (Saturday Night)\", the lead single from its sixth studio album, Pray for the Wicked (2018), which was released in June. Panic! at the Disco's seventh studio album, Viva Las Vengeance, was released on August 19, 2022.\n\nOn January 24, 2023, Urie officially announced that Panic! at the Disco would be disbanding following the conclusion of the Viva Las Vengeance Tour. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Panic%21+at+the+Disco\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Rooted in the Orange County community of Huntington Beach, the Dirty Heads emerged onto the Southern California music scene with their unique signature blend of acoustic infused hip-hop and classic reggae, creating the perfect soundtrack to an upbeat, sun-soaked California.\n\nFounding band members Jared Watson and guitarist\/vocalist Dustin Bushnell met in 1996 while in high school, embarking on a friendship based on music, as well as their shared passion for surfing, skating and the endless party of the laid-back SoCal lifestyle. \n\nEarly on, they spent many late nights jamming in Bushnell’s soundproof garage with a four-track recorder, writing unique acoustic hip-hop songs that featured reggae inflections. Inspired by the rock and reggae sounds of Bob Marley, Sublime, 311 and The Beastie Boys, the band’s music evolved into their distinct Dirty Heads style. \n\nTo complete the Dirty Heads’ sound, the duo added percussionist Jon Olazabal, drummer Matt Ochoa and David Foral on bass. With a set of solid material, the Dirty Heads were further motivated to take their craft to the next level, and they began building a loyal fan base throughout the west coast, while performing acoustically at local bars and small music venues. \n\nExecutive produced by the Grammy Award-winning Rob Cavallo (Green Day, Kid Rock, Paramore), the band connected with sought-after producers Steve Fox and Stan Frazier (Sugar Ray) working long hours to polish their material and further develop their style. The Dirty Heads also recruited mixing engineer Mario Caldato Jr., best known for his work with the Beastie Boys, to add the finishing touches and create just the right blend.\n\nThe band’s highly-anticipated expanded album titled, Any Port in a Storm – Special Edition (Executive Music Group (EMG)\/Fontana, a division of Universal Music Group Distribution) features 22 tracks and a bonus video that are reminiscent of the upbeat, sun-soaked Southern California party energy. The first smash hit single is “Lay Me Down” featuring Rome, of Sublime with Rome.  \n\nAny Port in a Storm also features one of the final recordings of the late music industry icon Billy Preston. Frequently referred to as “The Fifth Beatle,” Preston played on three tracks, including “Stand Tall,” “Chelsea,” and “Driftin.’ ” Additional special guests on the album are drummer Josh Freese (A Perfect Circle, Sting, The Vandals), and veteran session percussionist Alex Acuna, whose A-list musician resume includes Peter Gabriel, Johnny Clegg, and Jackson Browne, to name only a few. \n\nRecently, the band’s music has been attracting attention throughout the world of entertainment. They have been a featured artist on Fuel TV and their songs have been featured in the movie and soundtrack for Surf’s Up (Sony); and the television drama, Shark staring James Woods (CBS). Actor Matthew McConaughey selected the band’s music to be in his film, Surfer Dude. In addition, the Dirty Heads can be heard in Tony Hawk’s Downhill Jam video game (Activision), and several other music compilations and surf\/skate videos. On the marketing side, the Dirty Heads have also been included in campaigns for Etnies Jeans, Vestal Watches, Hurley, Skullcandy and more.\n\nDirty Heads vocalist Jared Watson sums up their fun, uncomplicated style, “We want to be positive and entertain,” he says. “We just want to make you feel good.” \n\n\nVisit the band at: www.dirtyheads.com and www.myspace.com\/dirtyheads  \n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/+noredirect\/Dirty+Heads\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The album produced the US and Canadian top-20 singles \"Take It Easy\" and \"Witchy Woman\".\n\nTheir second album, \"Desperado\" (1973), peaked at number 41 in the United States, and although the title track did not chart as a single, it gained lasting popularity. In 1974, Don Felder joined the band, contributing to the album \"On the Border\", which included the top-40 single \"Already Gone\" and their first number-one hit in the US and Canada, \"Best of My Love\". The 1975 album \"One of These Nights\" became their first US number-one album and achieved top-ten status in several other countries.

Schmit replaced Meisner. The following year, the band released \"The Long Run\", which featured the US number-one single \"Heartache Tonight\" and the top-ten hits \"The Long Run\" and \"I Can't Tell You Why\".

This was followed by the Long Road Out of Eden Tour in 2008. In 2013, they began the History of the Eagles Tour, coinciding with the release of a documentary of the same name.

        "biografia":"Falling in Reverse is an American rock band based in Las Vegas, Nevada and formed in 2008, signed to Epitaph Records. The band is led currently by vocalist Ronnie Radke alongside guitarists Christian Thompson and Marc Okubo, bassist Daniel \"DL\" Laskiewicz and drummer Luke Holland.\n\nIn 2008, lead singer Ronnie Radke was involved in an altercation in Las Vegas that resulted in the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Cook. While Radke did not shoot Cook, he was indicted on battery charges. These charges, combined with Radke's past troubles with narcotics and rehab, led to a suspended sentence and five years probation. After he failed to report to his probation officer he was arrested in June 2008, where his probation was revoked and he was mandated to serve his original sentence of two years in prison. At the time, Ronnie Radke was the lead singer of post-hardcore band Escape the Fate, which in 2006, released its debut album, Dying Is Your Latest Fashion. Following Radke's incarceration, he was ejected from the band and replaced by former Blessthefall lead singer Craig Mabbitt. Max Green, bassist of Escape the Fate, stated about Radke's law problems that, \"First we couldn't tour out of the country, then out of the state.\" Radke was released on December 12, 2010.\n\nDuring his time in prison, Radke formed a new band called From Behind These Walls. He officially began creating media with the band upon his release, but was later forced to change its name to Falling in Reverse due to copyright infringement. In 2009, with Radke still in prison, he was able to launch a demo of his band, due to contacts with several musicians he had. The demo contains four songs that were not put on the debut album The Drug in Me Is You. The original lineup consisted of Radke and bassist Nason Schoeffler, who helped find guitarist Jacky Vincent and rhythm guitarist Derek Jones. The band went through several drummers. Nick Rich was later replaced by Oscar Garcia, Khaled Biersack, and former LoveHateHero member Scott Gee, as official members, before finding former the Bigger Lights drummer Ryan Seaman. Schoeffler quit the band in April 2011 and was replaced by Mika Horiuchi, formerly of the band Cellador, who also later departed from the band after issues with Radke.\n\nIn January 2010, the band began recording for the first time. The group announced on December 20 that it would go to Orlando, Florida to record a full-length debut album over a period of two months with a tentative release date of the first quarter of 2011. The band also confirmed that Radke's friend, Michael Baskette, who has worked on Blessthefall's album Witness and Radke on Escape the Fate's debut Dying Is Your Latest Fashion, would produce the album. It was soon confirmed that the band was signed with Epitaph Records, Radke's former label with Escape the Fate, and the band released its debut album in 2011. The album was soon titled The Drug in Me Is You and was slated for a July 26, 2011 release date, with pre-orders beginning on June 7. The eleven song track list was released soon after. With the help of Executive Producer Michael \"Elvis\" Baskette, mixing and tracking for the album concluded on April 2, 2011. The album spawned the singles \"Raised by Wolves\" and \"The Drug in Me Is You\". The band's first music video was released for \"The Drug in Me Is You\" on June 28, 2011. The Drug in Me Is You was released in the United States on July 26, 2011 to mostly mixed reviews, but managed to sell 18,000 copies in its first week in the US charting at number 19 on the Billboard 200. A third single, \"I'm Not a Vampire\", was released a few months after the album's release on October 24 with an accompanying music video.\n\nThe songs for the debut album were all written by Radke during his imprisonment. Lead vocalist Ronnie Radke has often called the album a breakup record, but with a band and not a girl. Radke said that, \"I would think all day, for days and days, about what people would want to hear. I would dissect my old album and read all the fan letters and the reasons why they loved my band and why they listened to it. And I wrote about that, but in different ways. I don't know why these kids love the tragedies that I write about. I guess they can relate to it.\"\n\nIn January 2012, former I Am Ghost bassist Ron Ficarro began filling in as Falling in Reverse's The Drug in Me Is You Tour touring bassist due to the departure of former bassist Mika Horiuchi. Later on Ronnie announced on stage that Ron Ficarro was replacing Mika permanently.\n\nVocalist Ronnie Radke had been hinting on Twitter that the group had been working on the band's second album, with tweets such as \"You guys don't understand how many light years my next album is from the last one\". He and bandmate Ron Ficarro tweeted pictures of them in the studio with Ryan Ogren working on some new music. Ronnie had said a little bit about the new album to Marshal Music News. He said that, \"The last record was so vengeful and bitter and spiteful - so everyone is wondering what I'm gonna sing about next. And I'm just not quite ready to let people know. I'm sorry. When people hear the new stuff though I promise you they will lose their mind. It's light years ahead of my last album. We're demoing new songs right now, as we speak, and I'm telling you, people are seriously gonna lose their mind.\" During the band's performance at Dirt Fest 2012 in Birch Run Michigan, Radke announced to the crowd that it would be the group's last show before returning to the studio for the band's second album. Ronnie also said in an interview that the band would be in the studio late 2012 with demos already and hoping for an early 2013 release.\n\nOn May 7 the band released the first single and music video, \"Alone\", from the second album, titled, Fashionably Late. The cover, merchandise, and a June 18, 2013 release date was revealed on May 7 as well.\n\nOn May 21, the title track, \"Fashionably Late\" was released as the second single. Later, on May 30, the song, \"Born to Lead\" was streamed through YouTube. The entire album was uploaded to Epitaph Records' YouTube channel on June 12, allowing fans to listen to the album before the official release date.\n\nOn October 28, 2013, Falling in Reverse, along with Ronnie's former band Escape the Fate, announced that they would be touring together, with Falling in Reverse headlining, on the Bury The Hatchet Tour. The bands posted a video through Alternative Press with Ronnie and Escape the Fate singer Craig Mabbit being interviewed about the tour, stating that the tour came about due to the groups' acceptances of each other. During the tour, Ronnie made appearances on stage with Escape the Fate, singing the singles from Escape the Fate debut album Dying Is Your Latest Fashion (\"Situations\" and \"Not Good Enough for Truth in Cliché\").\n\nIn March 2014, Radke announced that the band had begun recording its third album. On May 12, 2014, it was announced by Alternative Press that Falling in Reverse had parted ways with bassist Ron Ficarro, reporting that former Escape the Fate bassist Max Green (who announced his departure from Escape the Fate just 3 days before on May 9, six months after rejoining Escape the Fate) would be his replacement. Ronnie is quoted as saying \"Ron was probably the best bass player I've ever played with, but at this moment in time I feel it is best to part ways with him. I respect him and wish nothing but the best for him. Max quitting Escape The Fate was like a godsend. It was a no brainer to have him join. I've known him half my life and this will be a great new chapter to start. \"\n\nIn an interview with MTV, Radke stated that the next album would be nothing like the single Alone from Fashionably Late as it has no raps throughout the album; he stated that it is heavier and will contain more screams, moving his passion for rapping into his solo career. Radke explained in another interview that the third album will be more like a \"sequel\" to the Escape the Fate album Dying Is Your Latest Fashion and is aimed to be nostalgic to people who were fans of the band since then.\n\nOn December 15, 2014, the first single from the band's third album, Just Like You, titled \"God, If You Are Above...\" was released. On January 13, 2015, the group released its second single \"Guillotine IV (The Final Chapter)\" from the album. Just Like You was released on February 24. In February 2015, touring bassist Jonathan Wolfe was replaced by the official new member, and former Black Tide bassist, Zakk Sandler. \"Stay Away\", another single off of Just Like You, premiered on the BBC Radio1 Rock Show on February 15. The group premiered its new single, Sexy Drug, via Alternative Press the next day.\n\nOn February 17, 2015, a full album stream of Just Like You was released, a week before the scheduled release of the album. On February 24, 2015, Just Like You was released as planned, along with a music video for the song Just Like You.\n\nOn October 30, 2015, lead guitarist Jacky Vincent left the band on good terms before the band's fall tour with Attila, Metro Station and Assuming We Survive to focus on his solo career. On November 4, 2015, Christian Thompson confirmed himself as the new lead guitarist of the band. The video for the single Chemical Prisoner was released on January 27, 2016. The single performed moderately well on UK rock radio.\n\nOn January 6, 2016, the band members announced that they had begun work on their next album stating that it would be \"It's a huge left turn. It sounds like nothing we’ve ever done. Every song is very vibey, There's more feeling in it instead of a lot of metal.\", further stating that \"We’re challenging ourselves now more than we ever have in the weirdest ways possible because you would think writing the craziest solo or riffs would be the challenging part. But the challenging part is trying to stick to a theme and not go all over the place like we would normally do.\" On December 19, the band officially released the first single \"Coming Home\" from the untitled album. In January 2017, Radke began performing guitar for the band. On January 20, 2017, the band announced their next album Coming Home, which was released on April 7. Around the time of its release, it was rumoured that drummer Ryan Seaman parted ways with the band. This was confirmed when the band performed on May 8, without Seaman with Chris Kamrada playing drums as a touring member, who since left to play for Dashboard Confessional.\n\nOn February 23 2018, the band released a song called, Losing My Mind.\n\nOn April 16 2018, Christian officially announced via his Instagram page that his time with Falling In Reverse had come to an end. Though there was some controversy over the exact reason behind it, claims came from both sides that the departure was mutual but talk arose of irreconcilable differences and a decision was made to go separate ways. It has since been claimed that the split was due to differences between members causing an uneasy working environment.\n\nOn June 26, 2018, the band released a song called, Losing My Life along with a music video as a continuation of where the music video for Losing My Mind ended and featured a new line-up for the band which consists of Tyler Burgess on bass, Max Georgiev as lead guitarist, drummer Brandon \"Rage\" Richter, and Zakk Sandler on keyboards and rhythm guitar. The band also announced that they will be performing selected dates at the final year of the annual Vans Warped Tour with the new line up.\n\nIn April 2020, rhythm guitarist Derek Jones passed away. He was 35 years old. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Falling+in+Reverse\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Justin, Mike, Jake, Nate and Tito from Anchor's Away, Dan from In Skies Of Black, Sam from Bright Lights and Bomb Shells. After years of just being in a bunch of different bands we all sat down and decided that this was it, do or die, it's time to really go for our dreams. We come before you humbled, and are ready for the masses to listen to what we have to tell you. We hope that while you listen to our music you don't just nod your head along, listen to the words we are saying.

They also released a cover of 'Lights!' -- A take on Ellie Goulding's original version. In early 2014, both vocalists, Sam Sky and Nate Newhard left the band. They were later replaced by new clean vocalist Angel Flores and unclean vocalist Nathan \"BAT\" Rodriguez. It was then that they entered the studio to start recording their next release when their drummer Tito Rivera left the band, to whom they replaced with the current drummer; Monev Tips. Following all of this they also got dropped by their record label. \n\nThe band, with the new lineup had then announced their new EP which has nine tracks, which was to be titled 'Solidarity' and was to be released sometime at the end of 2014. This was later pushed back due to the dropping of their band from the Rise\/Velocity Records roster. The band started the whole EP from scratch, and self-recorded it at King Studios (home to the band). The band also started a Go Fund Me account to raise money for their next self-acclaimed album. At the end of 2014, they released the first single from their EP, 'Try Hard'. On March 14th they released their second single 'Playing Through The Pain' and on March 21st they streamed their third song \"Black Smoke\".

        "biografia":"ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION (アジアン・カンフー・ジェネレーション Ajian Kanfuu Jenereeshon) is a Japanese alternative\/indie rock band formed in Yokohama in 1996.\n\nMembers:\nVocals & Guitar: 後藤正文 (Masafumi Gotoh)\nGuitar & Vocals: 喜多建介 (Kensuke Kita)\nBass & Vocals: 山田貴洋 (Takahiro Yamada)\nDrums: 伊地知潔 (Kiyoshi Ijichi)\n\n\nHistory:\n\nStarting out as a college band, Asian Kung-Fu Generation released a series of independent EPs featuring lyrics mostly sung in English. In 2002, they released their major-label EP debut Hōkai Amplifier, from that point singing their lyrics in Japanese. The band's musical style is influenced by seminal Western alternative rock acts as well as their own local Japanese indie rock and punk scene.Their songs incorporate various aspects of the genres, most typically expressing fast tempos and prominent power chord guitar riffs in addition to rhythmic groove and emotional lyrics. Despite the indie nature of their music, the band has enjoyed worldwide commercial success in addition to critical acclaim. Asian Kung-Fu Generation has been cited as one of the best, most balanced modern rock bands to emerge from Japan in the 2000s.\n\n1996–2002: Formation and indie releases\n\nAsian Kung-Fu Generation was first formed in 1996 when Masafumi Gotoh, Kensuke Kita, and Takahiro Yamada met while attending a music club at Kanto Gakuin University, a private university in Yokohama, Japan. After realizing that they all shared similar musical tastes, the three decided to start their own band. Masafumi Gotoh became the lead vocalist and played rhythm guitar, Kensuke Kita played lead guitar and sang backup, and Takahiro Yamada played bass. Drummer Kiyoshi Ijichi joined them later on after parting with another college band he was in. The four then began providing performances at their university as well as throughout the local Yokohama area. After graduating from college, following years of playing in several small venues and having collaborated with fellow Japanese rock musician Caramelman, AKFG released their first indie EP in 2000. The six-track EP contained original lyrics written and sung almost entirely in English. The four spent the remainder of the year playing in clubs and hosting independent events. The year after, the band made an attempt to attain airplay on indie radio stations for their first Japanese single, \"Konayuki\" (粉雪). The song was eventually picked up by a popular radio DJ and put into heavy rotation on the station FM Yokohama upon the demand of listeners. AKFG then released another indie EP, I'm Standing Here. This time, however, the band wrote songs in Japanese. At this time, the band had begun drawing an increasingly large number of audiences to their shows held in clubs in the districts of Shibuya, Shimokitazawa, Kichijōji, and Tokyo.\n\n2002–2004: Hōkai Amplifier and Kimi Tsunagi Five M\n\nOn November 25, 2002, after contributing to the Under Flowers Records compilation, Whatch You Gonna Do?, Asian Kung–Fu Generation officially released their first major-label mini-album, Hōkai Amplifier (崩壊アンプリファー). The group enlisted internet radio host and graphic artist Yusuke Nakamura to design and compose their single and album covers. The critically acclaimed EP topped the High Line Records' weekly chart for two consecutive weeks and peaked at number thirty-five on the Oricon indies sales chart.\n\nAs a result of its success, Hōkai Amplifier was re-released on April 23, 2003, by the band's new record label, Ki\/oon Records, a subsidiary of Sony Music Japan. A month later, AKFG held their first headline show at Shimokitazawa Club Shelter. That same summer, the band performed at the annual rock festivals of Fuji Rock Festival 03's \"ROOKIE A GO GO\" and Summer Sonic '03 in Tokyo and Osaka. On August 6, the band released their major-label debut single, \"Mirai no Kakera\" (未来の破片), with their second single, \"Kimi to Iu Hana\" (君という花), following shortly after. Days later, AKG held the first edition of what would become an annual festival, the Nano-Mugen Fes. The event took place on August 11 at the Shinjuku LOFT. The band followed it up by releasing their first full-length studio album, Kimi Tsunagi Five M (君繋ファイブエム) on November 19. The LP sold over 250,000 copies and landed in the number five spot on the Oricon charts in its first week. As their fame and following grew, fans began calling the band simply Ajikan (アジカン), an abbreviation of how the band's name is rendered in Japanese.\n\n2004–2005: Sol-fa\n\nAs they entered 2004, AKFG received the award for Best New Artist while their video for \"Kimi to Iu Hana\" won the award for Best Music Video at the SPACE SHOWER Music Video Awards. From January 19 to February 25, AKG held their first headlining tour: Five Nano Seconds. The tour consisted of thirteen shows. On July 1, the band held their third ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION presents Nano-Mugen Festival at the Tokyo arena Nippon Budokan. Over the course of the following summer, the band played in more than ten summer rock festivals, including Meet The World Beat, Rock In Japan Fes 04, and Fuji Rock Festival 04.\n\nOver the course of the year, the band released four more singles: \"Siren\" (サイレン), \"Loop & Loop\" (ループ＆ループ), \"Rewrite\" (リライト) and \"Kimi no Machi Made\" (君の街まで), before finally releasing their second full-length album, Sol-fa (ソルファ) on October 20. The album debuted at number-one on the Oricon charts where it stayed for two consecutive weeks and eventually went on to sell more than 600,000 copies. The album received critical praise for its honed sound and high production quality, which thoroughly nullified the language barrier that frequently impeded non–Japanese-speaking audiences. This notion became evident following the domestic release of Sol-fa, when AKFG fans from around the world organized themselves and petitioned for copies of the second album to be distributed outside Japan. The support for Ajikan eventually resulted in Tofu Records striking a contract to release Sol-fa in the United States on October 18. Additionally, the song \"Rewrite\" found recognition both domestically as well as on an international level when it was chosen as the fourth opening theme for the anime series Fullmetal Alchemist. Around the same time, their song \"Haruka Kanata\" enjoyed similar recognition after being used for the second opening of the anime series Naruto. Asian Kung–Fu Generation spent the next two months on a national tour consisting of twelve shows called \"Tour SUI CUP 2004 -No! Member, November.\" The tour included a prestigious headliner at Nippon Budokan arena. The four then released a year-end video DVD, izō Sakuhinshū Vol. 1 on November 26. The DVD is compilation of the music videos for all singles from \"Haruka Kanata\" to \"Kimi no Machi Made,\" including a never before seen clip of \"Siren.\" The video contains audio commentary for each song, a making-of featurette, and live footage derived from their concerts. In 2016, the song \"Re:Re:\" was rerecorded and used as the opening for the anime Erased.\n\n2005–2007: Fanclub and Feedback File\n\nDue in part to their growing recognition, Asian Kung-Fu Generation would dedicate a significant amount of time the next couple of years going on extensive national tours. Between March 14 and June 26 of 2005, AKG went on an extensive sold-out Re:Re Tour, performing at forty-eight concerts in thirty-eight cities throughout Japan. At the same time, the band released their second DVD, Eizō Sakuhinshū Vol. 2: Live at Budokan +. The two-disc video was the band's very first live DVD, as the first disc contains live footage of the entirety of the final show of their \"Tour Suihai 2004 - No!Member, November-,\" at Budokan, where they performed before an audience of over 10,000 people on December 5, 2004. Meanwhile, the second disc contains clips from their first concert at the Shimokitazawa Shelter Club on November 2, 2004. It also includes behind-the-scenes documentary directed by Toshiaki Toyoda and filmed at Kanto Gakuin University, as well as outtakes from the music video for \"Kimi to Iu Hana.\" Upon its release, the video managed to top the Oricon DVD charts for an entire month. On July 9, AKFG held their fifth Nano-Mugen Festival at Yokohama Arena, where they performed with seven other Japanese and UK bands. To advertise the event, they released a preceding compilation album that retained one song from each band attending the festival. Over the next summer, AKG attended a host of festivals, including Summer Sonic 05, Rising Sun Rock Fes. 2005, and Rock in Japan Fes. 05. They also appeared as guests on GOGOICHI –SPACE SHOWER CHART SHOW– on November 27 on SPACE SHOWER TV. The band closed the year by releasing the single, \"Blue Train\" (ブルートレイン), followed up by a brief tour entitled, \"Tour SUI CUP 2005 - Winter Dragon\" in December.\n\nThe band began 2006 with the release of their upcoming album's second single, \"World Apart.\" The single was unique in that it featured a song in which Kensuke Kita stood as lead singer. It was AKFG's first song to achieve number-one single status, also it was the year that the band was finally able to acquire their very own studio. They then took part in live performances in LIVE SUPERNOVA DX on February 16, 2006. On March 15, AKG released their third full-length album, Fanclub (ファンクラブ). The album peaked at number three and stayed in the Oricon top five for nearly two months. The following month, the band went on a national tour entitled, Count 4 My 8 Beat. Tickets for all thirty-eight shows quickly sold out. AKFG's sixth annual Nano-Mugen Fes. was held at Yokohama Arena. For two days, Asian Kung–Fu Generation and eleven other bands, including six Japanese bands, three American bands and two English bands, performed. Like the previous year, a compilation album was released in July to advertise the Nano-Mugen Festival. After three years of attending the Fuji Rock Fes, AKFG had the opportunity to perform on its coveted primary Green Stage for the first time at Fuji Rock Festival 06.\n\nTo commemorate their ten-year anniversary, Asian Kung–Fu Generation released their first compilation album, Feedback File on October 25. Rather than featuring hit singles, the nostalgic album was primarily compiled of B-sides, live performances, and old demos from their early indie days. Even though it retained little new material, the compilation was met by commercial success and managed to debut at number two on the Oricon charts. AKFG then went on a two-month arena tour entitled, Tour Sui Cup 2006-2007: The Start of a New Season. Well over 100,000 fans attended this tour, which traveled through eight cities and featured guest performances by bands from Japan and the United States. In the midst of the tour, AKFG was commissioned by the director of the then-upcoming anime film, Tekkon Kinkreet, to compose a theme song for the movie. The band created a song called, \"Aru Machi no Gunjō\" (或る街の群青) and released it as a year-end single prior to the film's debut. As a sign of their increasing cultural prominence, the band came to be parodied in a volume of the popular Hellsing manga by members of the Vatican named, \"The Vactikung.\"\n\n2007–2008: Withdrawal and World World World\n\nOn March 21, the band released another live DVD, Eizō Sakuhinshū Vol. 3 that contained footage of their previous tour. Although they took part in various domestic summer festivals, AKFG gradually became more and more withdrawn over the course of 2007 before halting appearances almost entirely, including the lack of their annual Nano-Mugen festival. Nevertheless, the band released the single \"After Dark\", which debuted in the top ten on the Oricon charts and was used as the seventh opening for the anime series Bleach.\n\nIn March of the following year, the band released their next album, World World World, accompanied by the single \"Korogaru Iwa, Kimi ni Asa ga Furu\" (転がる岩、君に朝が降る). Despite the lack of media appearances and the significant timespan between releases, the album debuted at #1 on the Oricon album chart.\n\nJust a few months after the album's release, Asian Kung–Fu Generation released their second major-label EP, Mada Minu Ashita ni, on June 11, 2008. The mini-album features songs conceived around the time of the recording of their preceding full-length album. Although the EP spawned no singles, the song \"Mustang\" managed to peak at number fifteen on the Japan Hot 100. The song was the band's very first entry on the newly established chart.\n\n2008–2009: Surf Bungaku Kamakura\n\nThe band appeared as a supporting act for a show held at Yokohama Bay Hall by American alternative rock band Third Eye Blind on July 18. Incidentally, Third Eye Blind later appeared for the fourth and final lineup of AKFG's seventh annual Nano-Mugen Festival held at the Yokohama Arena through July 20-21. The group was but one of a total of sixteen musical acts, originating from Japan, America, and the UK, who performed at the festival alongside Asian Kung–Fu Generation, who later released their third Nano-Mugen disc, Nano-Mugen Compilation 2008. Peaking at number eighteen on the Oricon charts and retaining one song from each of the sixteen groups, the compilation expressed the largest track number within the Nano-Mugen series yet. Additionally, the song \"Natsusemi\" (夏蝉, Summer Cicada), composed by AKFG just for the compilation, managed to peak at number thirty-six on the Japan Hot 100 despite not being released as a single.\n\nIn September, Asian Kung–Fu Generation had the opportunity to play side by side with Weezer, a California-based alternative rock band that had played a major influence on their music. The WEEZER FESTIVAL was Weezer's first tour to Japan in three years and in promotion of their The Red Album, they performed on September 13 at Intex Osaka and on the 15 at The National Yoyogi First Gymnasium in Tokyo. Asian Kung–Fu Generation, along with fellow Japanese rock band Going Under Ground, performed on both the Osaka and Tokyo stage.\n\nThey later released their twelfth single Fujisawa Loser in October followed by their fifth studio album Surf Bungaku Kamakura.\n\n2009–2012: Magic Disk and Best Hit AKG\n\nAfter a busy 2008, the band spent time touring and writing new material. In March 2009, they released their fifth DVD, Eizō Sakuhinshū Vol. 5, featuring a collection of live videos from various live events in 2008. In July 2009, Asian Kung–Fu Generation held their annual Nano-Mugen festival. This was accompanied by Nano-Mugen Compilation 2009, which featured a new track, \"Yoru no Call\" (夜のコール, Call of the Night), and tracks from each of the other 16 bands that partook in the festival. At the conclusion of the festival, Gotoh announced the group had started writing and producing a new album. Immediately following Nano-Mugen, the group kicked off their 2009 festival summer season with performances at Korea's Jisan Valley Rock Festival, \"Rock in Japan Festival 2009\", and \"Sweet Love Shower Festival 2009\". In October, their sixth DVD, Eizō Sakuhinshū Vol. 6, was released and was also the band's first release on Blu-ray. It featured a concert from their March 2009 hall tour \"World World World\", which featured a more experimental set design and set list, as well as the use of instruments such as tenori-on and a strings section. The second half of the set included the whole of their 2008 album Surf Bungaku Kamakura from start to finish.\n\nThe band released their 13th single, \"Shinseiki no Love Song\" (新世紀のラブソング, Love Song of the New Century), on December 2, 2009, which featured a DVD of songs from the group's appearance at Jisan Valley Rock Festival earlier in the year. At the same time, the band announced that at the end of March 2010, they would be releasing a new single titled \"Solanin\", which was to be used as the theme song to the film of the same name. The single featured a remix of \"Mustang\" from Mada Minu Ashita ni, which was a studio mix of the version played on Eizō Sakuhinshū Vol. 6. The track was also used as the ending theme to the movie.\n\nIn January 2010, Gotoh posted an entry into his diary stating that they had recorded a Japanese version of The Rentals song \"A Rose Is a Rose\". In February 2010, the band spent 2 weeks in New York, in which they recorded 2 songs. In the same month it was announced that the band would provide the opening theme for the anime The Tatami Galaxy, which features character design from Yusuke Nakamura, the same artist who illustrates the Ajikan CD covers. The song was titled \"Maigoinu to Ame no Beat\" (迷子犬と雨のビート, A Stray Puppy and the Beat of the Rain). A single release is to follow.\n\nIn April 2010, Gotoh posted an entry into his diary stating that the band's 6th full-length album would be released in June 2010 with the title \"Magic Disk\" (マジックディスク, Majikkudisuku).\n\nIn March 2011, the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami caused the band to cancel the rest of their \"2010-2011 Vibration of Music Tour\", due to some touring equipment being damaged. Within the next week after the disaster, Masafumi Gotoh published lyrics on his diary, inspired by the disaster, called \"Suna no Ue\" (砂の上, On the Sand). The song was later recorded, and was played on live radio airplay around Japan. In the next month, Gotoh later announced in his diary that they were in the studio, recording new songs. Two new AKG songs were released on the Nano-Mugen Compilation 2011, titled \"Hikari\" and \"All right Part 2\".\n\nIn July 2011, Asian Kung-Fu Generation played live at \"Jisan Valley Rock Festival\" an annual 3 day music festival held every July at Jisan Valley Ski Resort, in Icheon, South Korea.\n\nIn November 2011, the band announced that they would release a new single and a best of album. The single, titled \"Marching Band\", was released on November 30 and the best of album, Best Hit AKG, was released in January 2012. Gotoh announced via Twitter that the best of album does not represent the end of the band, and that they still plan on releasing an original album in summer, 2012.\n\n2022–present: Planet Folks and Surf Bungaku Kamakura Complete\n\nOn March 30, 2022, they released their tenth studio album Planet Folks. It included three previous singles alongside \"Flowers\" from Empathy's B-side and guest musicians such as ROTH BART BARON, Rachel of Chelmico, and OMSB. They released three music videos, \"You To You\", \"De Arriba\", and \"Hoshi no Yoru, Hikari no Machi\" and they held tour named \"Tour 2022 (Planet Folks)\" from May to November 2022 in Japan. Also in this tour, they replaced their longest support member Ryosuke Shimomura (who wanted to focus on his solo project) with YeYe, Achico, George, and Kikuchi Takuma. Documentary of Planet Folks album called \"(Planet Folks) 5-hour liner notes\" was released on Youtube and divided into several videos. At 2022 Space Shower Music Awards, they were awarded \"Best Respect Artist\".\n\nIn August 2022, they performed in Summer Sonic 2022 festival for first time since 2005. New single, \"Demachiyanagi Parallel Universe\" was selected as the opening theme of anime series The Tatami Galaxy's sequel, Tatami Time Machine Blues, which premiered in September 2022. In December 2022, it was announced that the song \"Shukuen\" by Asian Kung-Fu Generation will be the theme song for the 12th opening of the anime series Boruto: Naruto Next Generations. The single with the same name will be released on February 8, 2023. Also in December 2022, a cover version of \"Korogaru Iwa, Kimi ni Asa ga Furu\" was used as the ending song for the finale of anime series Bocchi the Rock! On January 18, 2023, the band released the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations opening \"Karma\" digitally, along with announcing a full CD single to be released on February 8.\n\nOn May 4, the band announced they would release a completed version of Surf Bungaku Kamakura on July 5, including a rerecording of the original album, and 5 new songs to cover the stations of the Enoshima Electric Railway line which did not originally have one. Two songs have been released as singles, \"Yanagikōji Parallel Universe\" and \"Nissaka Down Hill\", which are B-sides to Demachiyanagi Parallel Universe and Shukuen respectively. A national tour to promote the album later in the year was also announced shortly prior to the album's release.\n\nOn May 25, the band provided a song called \"Beautiful Stars\" for actress Non for her second album, Pursue and the band also featured in the music video.\n\nIn August 2023, the band was scheduled as guest in Kana-Boon's concert but cancelled it due to Ijichi tested positive for COVID-19. After he recovered, the band performed in some summer Japan festivals like Rock In Japan, Sweet Love Shower and Rush Ball. The band also performed live in Indonesia for the first time on August 18.\n\nIn July 2024, the band will be releasing a singles collection, a two-disc compilation of all A-sides released to commemorate the 20th anniversary of major debut. The collection will also include a re-recording of \"Haruka Kanata\".\n\nIn May and June 2025, the band will once again host Nano-Mugen Festival after an over decade-long hiatus. It will have an international date for the first time, to be held in Jakarta. Coinciding with the festival will be the release of a new double A-side single \"MAKUAKE\/Little Lennon\", with the former to be the theme song for this year's festival. In August, they will headline the Incheon Pentaport Rock Festival in South Korea.\n\n\nMusical style and influences:\n\nThe musical style of Asian Kung-Fu Generation largely has been influenced by seminal 1990s alternative rock and indie-rock bands, particularly Weezer, Oasis, Teenage Fanclub, Radiohead, Supergrass, Manic Street Preachers, Smashing Pumpkins and Beck. This is in conjunction with a wide variety of other genres, ranging from pop, garage, new wave, hardcore punk, and heavy metal. Members of ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION have imparted to being fans of Western music groups including The Beatles, XTC, The Pet Shop Boys and King Bee as well as fellow Japanese acts such as Number Girl, Eastern Youth, and Hi-Standard. As a result, many of the band's songs maintain a distinct balance of various elements of the genres, most typically expressing fast tempos, strong melodies, clear vocals, loud and distorted guitars, power chord sequences, rhythmic groove, hook-filled refrains, transgressive lyrics, and emotional delivery. Over the course of their career, the members of Asian Kung-Fu Generation, like most Japanese rock musicians, prefer to slightly expand their core sonic style with every release rather than drastically reinvent themselves. However, with their sixth studio album, the band uncharacteristically incorporated brass instruments, synthesizers, and string arrangements into their music. Ijichi is also a skilled pianist and can be heard playing an excerpt of \"Claire de Lune\" from French composer Claude Debussy's Suite bergamasque on their third studio album Fanclub.\n\nLeader singer Masafumi Gotoh typically employs quiet-loud dynamics, as his vocal style often alternates between soft, melodic singing, and harder, harsher, yelling. Gotoh serves as the band's main songwriter and is responsible writing a majority of their lyrics alongside playing the rhythm guitar. However, Gotoh tends to share songwriting duties among his bandmates, particularly with bassist Takahiro Yamada, whom he sometimes harmonizes with on songs. Lead guitarist Kensuke Kita also serves as a backup singer, and has been known to sing lead vocals on occasion.\n\n\nFormer touring members:\nDaisuke Kanazawa – keyboards (2010–2011)\nAi Iwasaki – backing vocals (2012–2013)[100]\nShigeo Mihara – percussion (2012–2013)[100]\nTadashi Ueda – keyboards, guitar (2012–2013)[100]\nRyousuke Shimomura – keyboards, guitar, percussion, backing vocals (2013–2021)\nTakuma Kikuchi (Mop of Head) – keyboards (2022)\nYeYe – backing vocals (2022)\nAchico – backing vocals (2022–2023)\nGeorge (Mop of Head) – keyboards (2022–2023)\n\n\nDiscography:\n\nStudio Albums\n2003.11.19 – Kimi Tsunagi Five M\n2004.10.20 – Sol-fa\n2006.03.15 – Fanclub\n2008.03.05 – World World World\n2008.11.05 – Surf Bungaku Kamakura\n2010.06.23 – Magic Disk\n2012.09.12 – Landmark\n2015.05.20 – Wonder Future\n2016.03.16 - Sol-fa 2016 (Re-Recording)\n2018.12.05 – Hometown\n2022.03.30 – Planet Folks\n2023.07.05 – Surf Bungaku Kamakura Complete (Re-Recording & new songs)\n\nEPs \/ Mini-Albums\n2000.00.00 - Caramelman and Asian Kung-Fu Generation\n2001.11.30 – I'm Standing Here\n2002.11.25 – Hōkai Amplifier\n2003.11.19 – Kimi Tsunagi Five M\n2008.06.11 - Mada Minu Ashita ni\n\nSingles\n2003.08.06 – Mirai no Kakera\n2003.11.19 – Kimi to Iu Hana\n2004.03.03 – Siren\n2004.05.19 – Loop & Loop\n2004.08.04 – Rewrite\n2004.10.06 – Kimi no Machi Made\n2005.01.19 – Blue Train\n2005.04.20 – World Apart\n2005.07.06 – Aru Machi no Gunjō\n2006.03.22 – After Dark\n2006.06.07 – Korogaru Iwa, Kimi ni Asa ga Furu\n2006.10.04 – Fujisawa Loser\n2007.01.24 – Shinseiki no Love Song\n2007.04.04 – Maigoinu to Ame no Beat\n2007.07.04 – Solanin\n2008.03.05 – Natsu Zemi\n2008.06.11 – Mada Minu Ashita ni\n2009.01.21 – Shinseiki no Love Song\n2009.04.08 – Sore de wa, Mata Ashita\n2010.03.10 – Ima o Ikite\n2011.06.29 – Wake Up!\n2012.06.27 – Kakato de Ai o Uchinarase\n2013.02.20 – Ima o Ikite\n2014.03.12 – Easter\n2015.03.25 – Right Now\n2016.07.06 – Re:Re:\n2017.03.22 – Blood Circulator\n2018.09.26 – Boys & Girls\n2019.05.29 – Dororo \/ Kaihōku\n2020.10.07 – Dialogue \/ Furetai Tashikametai\n2022.08.24 – Demachiyanagi Parallel Universe\n2023.02.08 – Shukuen\n2023.02.08 – Karma\n2025.05.21 – MAKUAKE \/ Little Lennon\n2025.10.XX – Life is Beautiful\n2025.10.XX – Fade to Black\n\nBest-of \/ Compilation Albums\n2005.10.25 – Feedback File\n2012.01.18 – Best Hit AKG\n2012.01.18 – Best Hit AKG Official Bootleg \"HONE\"\n2012.01.18 – Best Hit AKG Official Bootleg \"IMO\"\n2013.09.11 - The Recording at NHK CR-509 Studio (Live CD)\n2014.02.26 - Feedback File 2\n2018.03.28 – Best Hit AKG 2 (2012–2018)\n2018.03.28 – Best Hit AKG Official Bootleg \"HONE\"\n2018.03.28 – Best Hit AKG Official Bootleg \"IMO\"\n2024.07.31 – Single Collection\n\nOther \/ Various Releases\n2005.06.08 – ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION presents NANO-MUGEN COMPILATION\n2006.07.05 – ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION presents NANO-MUGEN COMPILATION 2006\n2008.07.09 – ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION presents NANO-MUGEN COMPILATION 2008\n2009.07.01 – ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION presents NANO-MUGEN COMPILATION 2009\n2011.06.29 – ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION presents NANO-MUGEN COMPILATION 2011\n2012.06.27 – ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION presents NANO-MUGEN COMPILATION 2012\n2013.06.05 – ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION presents NANO-MUGEN COMPILATION 2013\n2014.06.25 – ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION presents NANO-MUGEN COMPILATION 2014\n2017.03.29 – AKG TRIBUTE\n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.asiankung-fu.com\/s\/n80\/?ima=4759\nhttp:\/\/www.sonymusic.co.jp\/Music\/Info\/AKG\/eng\/ <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/ASIAN+KUNG-FU+GENERATION\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Héroes del Silencio (sometimes referred to as just Héroes) is a Spanish rock band from Zaragoza (Aragón, Spain) formed by Juan Valdivia. In the 1990s they experienced success around Spain and the Americas, and various European countries including Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, France and Portugal becoming a successful Spanish group and a fact in the history of the Rock en Español scene. After ten years and numerous albums, the band broke up in 1997. In 2007, as part of a 20-year anniversary celebration and 10 years after their break-up, they participated in a 10-concert world tour. Then later on the artist Enrique Bunbury went solo.\n\nThey started in 1984 as a band named Zumo de Vidrio. The original members were Enrique Bunbury, Juan Valdivia and his brother Pedro. Bunbury was originally a bass player but after Juan Valdivia heard him singing a David Bowie song and told him that he had a great voice, Bunbury became the vocalist.\n\nThe band changed their name to Héroes del Silencio in 1986. At first they played in public places and made demos but their break came when they participated in a music contest in Salamanca and won second place - an EMI producer, Gustavo Montesano, saw the band in the contest and some time later, at a concert in Sala En Bruto, he signed the band.\n\nTheir first album, \"Héroe de Leyenda\", was released in in 1987 and sold 30,000 copies. The following year, the album \"El Mar No Cesa\" was released, featuring the songs \"Mar Adentro\", \"Agosto\" and \"El Estanque\", and sold 100,000 copies. The supporting tour followed in 1989, documented on the limited edition live album \"En Directo\".\n\nIn 1990 they released \"Senderos de Traición\", their best-selling album with 2 million copies, including 400,000 copies in the first two weeks in Spain alone. The following year they started the tour \"Senda 91\" and released another live album, \"Senda 91\". 1992 saw the most important CD in their career, \"El Espíritu del Vino\". They sold 600,000 copies of this album which was played throughout America. They followed this with a tour for \"El Espíritu del Vino\". In 1993, Alan Bogulavsky joined the band.\n\nDue to tensions within the band, they took a hiatus and went to Benasque to take a vacation and heal the rifts within the group. After this break they gained a new producer, Bob Ezrin (Lou Reed, Pink Floyd, Peter Gabriel, Alice Cooper, Kiss, etc.) and in 1995 released \"Avalancha\", widely considered their best album. Avalancha was more hard rock than previous albums, with songs like \"Avalancha\", \"Deshacer el Mundo\" and \"Iberia Sumergida\". The album was followed by the Avalancha tour in 1995 and 1996, which produced the live album \"Parasiempre\".\n\nThe band split in 1996 though this did not prevent the release of the \"Rarezas\" album in 1998. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/+noredirect\/Heroes+Del+Silencio\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"\nJohn Hiatt (born on August 20, 1952 in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S.) is an American blues and rock guitarist, pianist, and singer-songwriter. He has been nominated for eleven Grammy Awards. Hiatt's sales have never quite matched his reputation. His songs have been covered by a wide variety of artists such as Bonnie Raitt, Ronnie Milsap, Willie Nelson, Iggy Pop, Three Dog Night, and The Neville Brothers, yet it took him thirteen years to reach the charts himself.\n\nAs well, it nearly took him that long to find his own style. Hiatt began his solo career in 1974, and over the next decade he ran through a number of different styles from rock & roll to new wave-esque pop before he finally settled on a rootsy fusion of rock, country, blues, and folk with his 1987 album 'Bring the Family'. Though the album didn't set the charts on fire, it became his first album to gain some major commercial success, and several of the songs on the record became hits for other artists, including the aforementioned Raitt and Milsap. Following its success, Hiatt became a reliable hit songwriter for other artists, and he developed a strong cult following that continued to gain strength into the mid-90s.\n\nWhile he was growing up in his hometown of Indianapolis, Indiana, Hiatt played in a number of garage bands. Initially, he was inspired by the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan, and the music of those two artists would echo strongly throughout his work. Out of all the bar bands he played with in the late 60s, a group called The White Ducks was the one that received the most attention. Following his high-school graduation, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee at the age of 18, where he landed a job as a songwriter for Tree Publishing.\n\nFor the next several years, he wrote and performed at local clubs and hotels. Within a few years, his songs were being recorded by several different artists, including Conway Twitty, Tracy Nelson, and Three Dog Night, who took Hiatt's \"Sure as I'm Sittin' Here\" to number 16 in the summer of 1974. Eventually, his manager secured him an audition at Epic Records, and the label signed him in 1974, releasing his debut album, Hangin' Around the Observatory, later that year. Despite their critical acclaim, neither Hangin' Around the Observatory nor its 1975 follow-up Overcoats sold many copies, and he was dropped by the label. By the end of the year, Tree Publishing had let him go as well.\n\nFollowing his failure in Nashville, Hiatt moved out to California. By the summer of 1978 he had settled in Los Angeles, where began playing in clubs, opening for folk musicians including Leo Kottke. With Kottke's assistance, Hiatt hired a new manager, Denny Bruce, who helped him secure a record contract with MCA Records. Slug Line, his first record for MCA, was released in the summer of 1979. Where his first two records were straight-ahead rock & roll and folk-rock, Slug Line was in the new wave vein of angry English singer\/songwriters like Elvis Costello, Graham Parker, and Joe Jackson, as if Hiatt was vying for the role of the American angry young man. The new approach earned some strong reviews, yet it failed to generate any sales. Two Bit Monsters, his second MCA album, faced the same situation. Although it was well-received critically upon its 1980 release, it made no impression on the charts, and the label dropped him.\n\nApart from working on Two Bit Monsters, Hiatt spent most of 1980 as a member of Ry Cooder's backing band, playing rhythm guitar on the Borderline album and touring with the guitarist. Hiatt stayed with Cooder throughout 1981, signing a new contract with Geffen Records by the end of the year. Produced by Tony Visconti (David Bowie, T. Rex), his Geffen debut All of A Sudden was released in 1982, followed by the Nick Lowe\/Scott Matthews & Ron Nagel-produced Riding With the King in 1983. As with his previous records for Epic and MCA, neither of his first two Geffen releases sold well. By this time, Hiatt's personal life was beginning to spin out of control as he was sinking deep into alcoholism. Around the time he completed 1985's Warming Up to the Ice Age, his second wife committed suicide. Following the release of Warming Up to the Ice Age, Hiatt was dropped by Geffen. By the end of 1985, he had entered a rehabilitation program. During 1986, he remarried and signed a new deal with A&M Records.\n\nFor his A&M debut, Hiatt assembled a small band comprising his former associates Ry Cooder (guitar), Nick Lowe (bass), and Jim Keltner (drums). Recorded over the course of a handful of days, the resulting album, Bring the Family, had a direct, stripped-down rootsy sound that differed greatly from his earlier albums. Upon its summer 1987 release, Bring the Family received the best reviews of his career and, for once, the reviews began to pay off, as the album turned into a cult hit, peaking at 107 on the U.S. charts; it was his first charting album. Hiatt attempted to record a follow-up with Cooder, Lowe, and Keltner, but the musicians failed to agree on the financial terms for the sessions. Undaunted, he recorded an album with John Doe, David Lindley, and Dave Mattacks, but he scrapped the completed project, deciding that the result was too forced. Hiatt's final attempt at recording the follow-up to Bring the Family was orchestrated by veteran producer Glyn Johns, who had him record with his touring band, the Goners. Despite all of the behind-the-scenes troubles behind its recording, the follow-up album, Slow Turning, actually appeared rather quickly, appearing in the summer of 1988.\n\nSlow Turning, like Bring the Family before it, received nearly unanimous positive reviews and it was fairly well-received commercially, spending 31 weeks on the U.S. charts and peaking at 98. Within the next year, Hiatt successfully toured throughout America and Europe, strengthening his fan base along the way. Inspired by the success of Hiatt's two A&M albums, Geffen released the compilation Y' All Caught? The Ones That Got Away 1979-85 in 1989. That same year, other artists began digging through Hiatt's catalog of songs, most notably Bonnie Raitt, who covered \"Thing Called Love\" for her multi-platinum comeback album, Nick of Time.\n\nIn 1990, Hiatt returned with Stolen Moments, which was nearly as successful as Slow Turning, both critically and commercially. \"Bring Back Your Love to Me,\" an album track from Stolen Moments that was also recorded by Earl Thomas Conley, won BMI's 1991 Country Music Award. By the time \"Bring Back Your Love to Me\" won that award, it had become a standard practice for artists to cover Hiatt's songs, as artists as diverse as Bob Dylan, Ronnie Milsap, Suzy Bogguss, and Iggy Pop all covered his songs in the early '90s. In 1993, Rhino Records released Love Gets Strange: The Songs of John Hiatt, which collected many of the cover versions that were recorded during the '80s and '90s.\n\nDuring 1991, the group that recorded Bring the Family — Hiatt, Cooder, Lowe, and Keltner — re-formed as a band called Little Village, releasing their eponymous debut in early 1992. Based on the success of Bring the Family and Hiatt's A&M albums, expectations for Little Village were quite high, yet the record and its supporting tour were considered a major disappointment. Later, the individual members would agree that the band was a failure, mainly due to conflicting egos.\n\nHiatt decided to back away from the superstar nature of Little Village for his next album, 1993's Perfectly Good Guitar. Recorded in just two weeks with a backing band comprised of members of alternative rock bands School of Fish and Wire Train, the album was looser than any record since Bring the Family, but it didn't quite have the staying power of its two predecessors, spending only 11 weeks on the charts and peaking at number 47. The following year, he released his first live album, Hiatt Comes Alive at Budokan? Hiatt left A&M Records after the release of the record, signing with Capitol Records the following year.\n\nWalk On, Hiatt's first Capitol album, was recorded during his supporting tour for Perfectly Good Guitar and featured guest appearances by the Jayhawks and Bonnie Raitt. Walk On entered the charts at 48, but slipped off the charts in nine weeks, indicating that his audience had settled into a dedicated cult following. Fittingly, after 1997's Little Head quickly came and went in the marketplace, Hiatt parted ways with Capitol, and his next album, 2000's Crossing Muddy Waters was released on the established independent imprint Vanguard Records. After a second album with Vanguard, The Tiki Bar Is Open, Hiatt alligned himself with another independent label, New West, for the release of his 2003 set Beneath This Gruff Exterior. Master of Disaster, along with CD and DVD versions of Live from Austin, TX followed in 2005. \n\nSame Old Man followed in 2008; then The Open Road in 2010.\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/John+Hiatt\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Bon Jovi is an American rock band formed in 1983 in Sayreville, New Jersey. It consists of singer Jon Bon Jovi, keyboardist David Bryan, drummer Tico Torres, guitarist Phil X, and bassist Hugh McDonald. Original bassist Alec John Such quit the band in 1994, and longtime guitarist and co-songwriter Richie Sambora left in 2013. The band has been credited with \"[bridging] the gap between heavy metal and pop with style and ease\".\n\nIn 1984 and 1985, Bon Jovi released their first two albums and their debut single \"Runaway\" managed to crack the Top 40. In 1986, the band achieved widespread success and global recognition with their third album, Slippery When Wet, which sold over 20 million copies and included three Top 10 singles, two of which reached No. 1 (\"You Give Love a Bad Name\" and \"Livin' on a Prayer\") Their fourth album, New Jersey (1988), was also very successful, selling over 10 million copies and featuring five Top 10 singles (a record for a glam metal album), two of which reached No. 1 (\"Bad Medicine\" and \"I'll Be There for You\"). After the band toured and recorded extensively during the late 1980s, culminating in the 1988–1990 New Jersey Tour, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora released successful solo albums in 1990 and 1991, respectively.\n\nIn 1992, the band returned with the double-platinum Keep the Faith. This was followed by their biggest-selling and longest-charting single \"Always\" (1994) and the album These Days (1995), which proved to be a bigger success in Europe than in the United States, producing four Top Ten singles in the United Kingdom. Following a second hiatus, their 2000 album Crush, particularly the lead single, \"It's My Life\", successfully introduced the band to a younger audience, and the band considered this their comeback album. The band followed up with Bounce in 2002. The platinum albums Have a Nice Day (2005) and Lost Highway (2007) saw the band incorporate elements of country music into some of the songs, including the 2006 single \"Who Says You Can't Go Home\", which won the band a Grammy Award and became the first single by a rock band to reach No. 1 on the country charts. The Circle (2009) marked a return to the band's rock sound. The band also enjoyed great success touring, with both the 2005–2006 Have a Nice Day Tour and 2007–2008 Lost Highway Tour ranking among the Top 20 highest-grossing concert tours of the 2000s. After recording and releasing Because We Can in 2013, lead guitarist Richie Sambora left the band just before an April concert during the supporting tour to spend more time with his family. The band released their first studio album without Sambora, Burning Bridges, in 2015 and the follow-up album This House Is Not for Sale in 2016, the tour for which encompassed 2017–2019. Their most recent album 2020 (2020) was re-worked to include songs inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic and George Floyd protests; its supporting tour was delayed to 2022.\n\nBon Jovi has released 15 studio albums, five compilations and three live albums. They have sold more than 120 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling American rock bands, and performed more than 2,700 concerts in over 50 countries for more than 34 million fans. Bon Jovi was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, and into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018. The band received the Award of Merit at the American Music Awards in 2004, and Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora were inducted into Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2009.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bon_Jovi\n\nStudio albums\nBon Jovi (1984)\n7800° Fahrenheit (1985)\nSlippery When Wet (1986)\nNew Jersey (1988)\nKeep the Faith (1992)\nThese Days (1995)\nCrush (2000)\nBounce (2002)\nHave a Nice Day (2005)\nLost Highway (2007)\nThe Circle (2009)\nWhat About Now (2013)\nBurning Bridges (2015)\nThis House Is Not for Sale (2016)\n2020 (2020)\nForever  (2024) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Bon+Jovi\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Onfroy was known for his versatility with his music, which ranges from aggressive, punk rock-inspired hip hop, to somber and slower R&B style songs, to even heavy metal. His music is known for the lofi sound quality of his vocals and songs, which normally are distorted and unmastered. His vocal style ranged from singing, rapping, and screaming. Onfroy was also known for his violent outbursts in public life, with numerous arrests related to assault, robbery, and weapon possession. \n\nOnfroy's most popular song to-date is Look at Me, which was originally released in 2016 and re-released in 2017, and peaked at number 42 on US Billboard Hot 100. The single helped him gain more popularity in early 2017 due to accusations of Canadian rapper Drake using a similar rap flow in his then unreleased song, now released under the name \"KMT\", that he previewed at a concert in Amsterdam featuring British rapper Giggs.\n\nIn July 2016, Onfroy was arrested and charged with robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. After posting bail in early October of the same year, while awaiting trial, Onfroy was arrested again later that month on charges of false imprisonment, witness tampering, and aggravated battery of a pregnant victim. Onfroy was released from jail on bail on March 26, 2017.\n\nOnfroy announced his debut studio album, 17 on July 30, 2017. The album released on August 25, 2017. It features 11 tracks and includes the lead single Revenge.\n\nOnfroy was shot and killed on June 18, 2018, in Deerfield Beach, Florida.  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/XXXTENTACION\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

He is one of the most prominent figures in hip hop, known for his diverse musical style and polarizing cultural and political commentary. After dropping out of college to pursue a career in music, West began producing for regional artists in the Chicago area. As an in-house producer for Roc-A-Fella Records, he co-produced albums including Jay-Z's The Blueprint (2001) before signing with the label as a recording artist. West's debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), received critical acclaim and produced the Billboard Hot 100 number-one single \"Slow Jamz.\" He topped the chart four other times with the singles \"Gold Digger\" (2005), \"Stronger\" (2007), \"E.T.\" (2011, as a featured artist), and \"Carnival\" (2024).\n\nWest's second and third studio albums, Late Registration (2005) and Graduation (2007), both debuted at the top of the Billboard 200, with the latter becoming his most commercially successful to date. Three of his subsequent albums—808s & Heartbreak (2008), My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010), and The Life of Pablo (2016)—were certified triple platinum, while Yeezus (2013) was certified double platinum. Although not as well-received critically as his previous works, Ye (2018), Jesus Is King (2019), and Donda (2021) continued West's streak of consecutive number-one debuts on the Billboard 200. West has also released collaborative albums including Watch the Throne (2011) with Jay-Z, Kids See Ghosts (2018) with Kid Cudi, and Vultures 1 and Vultures 2 (2024) with Ty Dolla Sign. In fashion design, he has collaborated with Nike, Inc., Louis Vuitton, and Gap Inc. on clothing and footwear, and led the Yeezy collaboration with Adidas.\n\nOne of the world's best-selling music artists with 160 million records sold, West has won 24 Grammy Awards, the joint 11th-most of all time and the most awarded for any hip hop artist along with Jay-Z. His other accolades include a Billboard Artist Achievement Award, a joint-record three Brit Awards for Best International Male Solo Artist, and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. West holds the joint record with Bob Dylan for most albums (four) topping the annual Pazz & Jop critic poll. Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2005 and 2015. West's first six solo albums were included on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list in 2020, with the same publication naming him one of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time.\n\nWest's outspoken views have received significant media coverage. He has been a frequent source of controversy due to his conduct on social media, at award shows, and in public settings, as well as his comments on the music and fashion industries, U.S. politics, race, and slavery.

        "biografia":"Three Days Grace is a Canadian rock band, formed under the name Groundswell in Norwood, Ontario, Canada in 1992. After a breakup in 1995, the band reformed in 1997 under its current name and with a line-up consisting of guitarist and lead vocalist Adam Gontier, drummer and backing vocalist Neil Sanderson, and bassist Brad Walst. In 2003, Barry Stock was recruited as the band's lead guitarist. The band has released seven studio albums, with a record fourteen #1 hits on Mainstream Rock.\n\nAfter signing to Jive Records, Three Days Grace released two studio albums, Three Days Grace in 2003 and One-X in 2006, both of which have been certified platinum and double platinum in the US and Canada, respectively. In 2007, the band was declared number one rock artist of the year by Billboard and was the number four artist in airplay in Canada that same year. The band's third album, Life Starts Now, was released on September 22, 2009.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThree Days Grace formed in 1992 under the name Groundswell in Norwood, Ontario, Canada. Groundswell's line-up consisted of five members: Adam Gontier (vocals, guitar), Neil Sanderson (backing vocals, drums), Brad Walst (bass), Phil Crowe (guitar), and Joe Grant (guitar), all of whom were attending high school when the band formed.\n\nIn 1997, after being disbanded for two years, the band regrouped in Toronto as a trio consisting of Gontier, Sanderson, and Walst. They also changed their name to \"Three Days Grace\". According to Gontier, the name stands for the question: If you had three days to change something in your life, could you do it? Once in Toronto, the band became acquainted with local producer Gavin Brown. The band gave him several years of material that they had created since forming, and he \"picked out what he called 'the golden nuggets'\", according to Gontier. Brown and the band polished the songs into a demo album which they gave to EMI Music Publishing Canada. The record label wanted to hear more material, and with Brown producing, the band created the song, \"I Hate Everything About You\", which attracted the interest of several record labels. The band was soon signed to Jive Records after being sought out by the company's president.\n\n\nThree Days Grace (2003 - 2005)\n\nAfter being signed to Jive, the band moved to Long View Farms, a studio in Boston, to record their debut album. The self-titled album was finished in Woodstock, New York and released on July 22, 2003. It was met with generally favorable reviews. Dave Doray of IGN said of the album, \"Mistakes? There's not many.\" Allmusic reviewer Heather Phares said that on Three Days Grace, \"the band's focus and adherence to alt-metal's formulas — coupled with tight songwriting and some unexpectedly pretty choruses — results in a strong tracks that are more memorable than the work of many of their peers\". She did criticize the album for its simplicity, concluding, \"Three Days Grace are definitely one of the most accessible alt-metal bands of the 2000s; they just need to add some more distinctiveness to their sound.\"\n\nAfter acquiring lead guitarist Barry Stock in late 2003, Three Days Grace toured continuously and extensively for almost two years in support of their major label debut. The album peaked at number nine on the Canadian Albums Chart and number 69 on the Billboard 200 and was certified platinum in the US by the RIAA in December 2004 and double platinum in Canada by the CRIA.\n\n\nOne-X (2006 - 2008)\n\nWhile touring in support of Three Days Grace, Gontier became depressed and addicted to drugs and alcohol. He went into rehab after the band finished touring, and while there, began writing material for the band's second album. After leaving rehab, he rejoined the band in a cottage in Ontario to finish writing material for the album. In a 2006 interview, Gontier said that the album's material was more personal to him than the band's previous release, being based on the despondence, drug abuse, and rehab that constituted the past two years of his life. The album, titled One-X, was then released on June 13, 2006, and was guitarist Barry Stock's recorded debut.\n\nOne-X was met with generally favorable reviews. The Toronto Star complimented the album with a review title of \"One CD worth buying...\" and focused on its lyrics, saying, \"The lyrics really speak out to you, especially if you're going through a tough time in your life.\" Allmusic reviewer Corey Apar praised the music, saying it \"remains catchy despite its lyrical darkness\". The album did receive some negative criticism. Apar pointed out that Three Days Grace is \"hardly innovative\" in their approach to writing music and that \"further distinctive qualities\" would help the band separate itself \"from their alt-metal peers\".\n\nOne-X peaked at number two on the Canadian album chart and at number five on the Billboard 200, selling 78,000 copies in the US in its first week of release. Its first single, \"Animal I Have Become\", was Three Days Grace's most successful, becoming 2006's most played rock song in Canada, and the album helped propel Three Days Grace to become the number one rock artist in airplay in the US and Canada in 2007, with Billboard ranking them as the number one rock artist of the year in 2007. One-X was certified platinum by the RIAA in the US on August 30, 2007, and double platinum by the CRIA in Canada in July 2007. Three Days Grace toured the US and Canada throughout the second half of 2006 and all of 2007 in support of One-X. In early 2008, they toured alongside Seether and Breaking Benjamin across the US\n\n\nLife Starts Now (2009 - 2011)\n\nFrom March to August 2008, to January to April 2009, Three Days Grace recorded their third album at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, British Columbia, and Los Angeles, with producer Howard Benson, who had worked with them on their previous releases. The album, entitled Life Starts Now, was released on September 22, 2009. Critics as well as band members have noted the album's departure from the angry tone of the band's previous releases into a lyrical style that comes off as more optimistic. According to guitarist Barry Stock, the album's theme centers around \"a new sense of freshness\" and the idea that \"you don't have to be stuck in whatever it is you're dealing with. Whether it's good or bad, it's your choice to make a change.\"\n\nLife Starts Now debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, Three Days Grace's highest chart position, and sold 79,000 copies in its first week. The album was met with mixed reviews. Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star gave the album a negative review, saying it possesses \"no sound of its own, just a shallow range between Linkin Park and Nickelback\". According to Allmusic reviewer James Christopher Monger, who gave the album three out of five stars, Life Starts Now continues the theme of One-X, Gontier's personal demons, but with a \"hint of sunlight\". He compliments the album, saying it \"treats the well-worn metal themes of anger, isolation, heartache, and redemption with the kind of begrudging respect they deserve, pumping out a competent flurry of fist-bump anthems and world-weary, midtempo rockers\".[32] Harsher negative reviews came from Ben Czajkowski from 411mania.com as he described the album as \"Boring, bland, trite, tired, tried, and true\".\n\nThe first single from the album, \"Break\", was released on September 1, 2009. Three Days Grace embarked on a 20-date Canadian tour lasting through November and December 2009.[36] They co-headlined a January–February 2010 tour of the US with Breaking Benjamin and Flyleaf.\nThey embarked on a US headlining tour with support from Chevelle, and Adelitas Way starting on March 26, 2010 in Grand Rapids, Michigan and ending on April 16, 2010 in Springfield, Massachusetts.\n\nThree Days Grace went on tour with Nickelback and Buckcherry on the Dark Horse Fall 2010 Tour. They toured with My Darkest Days starting in March 2011 in Seattle, Washington.[39] They also joined Avenged Sevenfold on their Spring \"Welcome to the Family\" tour in 2011.[citation needed] They toured with Avenged Sevenfold, Seether, Escape The Fate, and Bullet For My Valentine on the Rockstar Energy Drink Uproar tour from August 2011 to October 2011. It was their last album under Jive Records and their first album under Sony Music Entertainment after the Sony BMG joint venture ended, moving all former BMG labels to the new Sony Music Entertainment.\n\n\nTransit of Venus and Gontier's departure (2012 - present) \n\nOn October 7, 2011, RCA Music Group announced it was disbanding Jive Records along with Arista Records and J Records. With the shutdown, the band (and all other artists previously signed to these three labels) will release their future material (including their upcoming fourth studio album) on the RCA Records brand.\n\nOn June 5, 2012, at 9:00 A.M. PST, the same day as Venus' visible transit across the sun, the band announced that their fourth studio album will be called Transit of Venus and that it is set to be released October 2, 2012. They created an early promotional video that was released on their website, featuring clips of them in the studio as well as footage of the physical transit of Venus. Due to the rarity of this occurrence, they created the slogan, \"some things will never happen again in your lifetime\", reflecting both this uncommon occurrence as well as the mood that the lyrics and music will most likely take on. The first single on the album, \"Chalk Outline\", was released August 14.\n\nOn January 9, 2013, Three Days Grace announced that Adam Gontier was resigning from the band. Brad's brother, Matt Walst of My Darkest Days, would be touring with the band as lead vocals. They cited Adam Gontier's sudden departure due to medical reasons.\n\nThree Days Grace kicked off their 2013 tour in Moline, IL with Matt Walst as touring lead singer; he later became a permanent member of the band.\n\nAwards\n\nThree Days Grace has been recognized for their musical efforts through several awards and nominations. In 2007, the band was ranked by Mediabase as the top artist in airplay across all rock formats in the US and Canada, and Billboard named them Rock Artist of the Year. Three Days Grace has been nominated for four Juno Awards. In 2004, the band was nominated for New Group of the Year.[49] \"I Hate Everything About You\" was nominated for Best Rock Video and People's Choice: Favourite Canadian Group at Much Music Awards. In 2007, they were nominated for Best Group of the Year, and their album One-X was nominated for Album of the Year.[51] The band's first single from One-X, \"Animal I Have Become\", was Canada's most played rock song in 2006 and won that year's Mediabase award for the most played rock song on radio. \"Never Too Late\" was nominated for Best Video and Best Rock Video and \"Pain\" was nominated for Best International Video by a Canadian and People's Choice: Favorite Canadian Group at Much Music Awards.\n\nIn 2010, Life Starts Now was nominated for best Rock Album at the Juno awards but lost to Billy Talent III. In 2010, \"Break\" was nominated for Best Post Production Video and Best Rock Video of the year at Much Music Awards.On Fuse.tv. \"Break\" was nominated for \"Best Single\" and \"Life Starts Now\" won for \"Best Album\" at the Casby Awards.\n\n\nMusical style and influences\n\nThree Days Grace's musical style has generally been described by critics as alternative metal and hard rock throughout the band's career. Heather Phares of Allmusic, in a review of the band's debut album, compared them to rock bands Chevelle and Helmet. Dave Doray of IGN described Three Days Grace as \"heavy and catchy, with chewy chunks of assurance and fury thrown in for added measure.\" Allmusic's Corey Apar said One-X brings an \"accessible alt-metal attack of blunt lyrics and crunching rhythms\" that retains the melodic sound of its predecessor \"despite its lyrical darkness\".\n\nThe band has listed numerous influences in their music. Gontier has mentioned such bands as Sunny Day Real Estate, Kyuss, Nine Inch Nails, and Tool as influences for the band's music. According to Gontier, the lyrics for Three Days Grace songs have mostly been influenced by the Seattle music scene. He summarized about the band's influences in an interview, \"Musically there's a lot of different influences, but lyrically it's hard to have different influences because you just write.\"\n\n\nBand members:\n\nCurrent Members\n\n* Matt Walst – lead vocals (2013-present)\n* Brad Walst – bass guitar, backing vocals (1997 - present)\n * Neil Sanderson – drums, backing vocals (1997 - present)\n * Barry Stock – lead guitar (2003 - present)\n* Adam Gontier – lead vocals, rhythm guitar (1997–2013 \/ 2024 - present)\n\n\n\nLive Members\n\n* Dani Rosenoer  – piano, synthesizer, backing vocals (2012-present)\n\n\nThree Days Grace discography\n\n    * Three Days Grace (2003)\n    * One-X (2006)\n    * Life Starts Now (2009)\n    * Transit of Venus (2012)\n    * Human (2015)\n    * Outsider (2018)\n    * EXPLOSIONS (2022) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Three+Days+Grace\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Shinedown is a Hard Rock band from Jacksonville, Florida. Shinedown was formed in early 2002 by Brent Smith, Jasin Todd, Brad Stewart, and Barry Kerch. They have released seven albums on Atlantic Records: \"Leave a Whisper\" (2003),\"Us and Them\" (2005), \"The Sound of Madness\" (2008), \"Amaryllis\" (2012), \"Threat to Survival\" (2015) , \"Attention Attention\" (2018) and \n\"Planet Zero\" (2022). As of 2018, the band has had 23 Top 5 hits on Mainstream Rock radio, including 12 number one singles, and a Top 10 hit on the Hot 100 with \"Second Chance\".\n\nOn July 13, 2003, the band released their debut album Leave A Whisper. The album sold the popular singles \"Fly From The Inside\" and \"45\". Leave A Whisper was re-released on June 15, 2004, to capitalize on the strength of a new single: A cover of Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Simple Man\". This song is often dedicated to their friend Dimebag Darrell who died in 2004. The re-release also featured an acoustic version of \"45\", and a new mix of \"Burning Bright\", which was to be the fourth single from the album. During 2004, the band notably opened for Van Halen. On September 21, 2005, Leave A Whisper was certified as gold. On August 23, 2005, the band released a live DVD called Live From The Inside that contained a full-length Shinedown concert held at the House Of Blues in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.\n\nOn October 4, 2005, the band released their second album called Us And Them, backed by the single \"Save Me\". Save Me maintained a #1 position on active rock charts for twelve weeks. The song became the theme song for WWE No Mercy 2005. The follow-up single, \"I Dare You\", also did respectably, and became one of the theme songs of WWE's WrestleMania 22 and was also performed on American Idol by Chris Daughtry. There are currently three versions of Us And Them: the regular thirteen-track version, a limited edition with three bonus acoustic tracks, and a store-specific edition with two bonus tracks: \"Break\" and \"Carried Away\". In 2006, the band co-headlined the SnoCore Tour with Seether, Flyleaf, and Halestorm, which was followed by the Equinox Tour in which Shinedown co-headlined with Trapt. Shinedown played their first overseas concert at the London Astoria on June 6, 2006, supporting Alter Bridge. In the late summer of 2006, the band opened for Godsmack and Rob Zombie on their North American Tour.\n\nOn December 12, 2006, Shinedown played in Knoxville, Tennessee at The Tennessee Theatre which was filmed for an upcoming DVD the band was expected to be releasing later this year (2007). However, after a recent show, Waukesha, WI, July 21, 2007, the band made it known that the DVD was scrapped by Atlantic Records.\n\nThe band began recording their new album in Los Angeles on September 20, 2007. Their first single, Devour, was released on May 20, 2008, and has proven a successful single, with it charting in the Top 10. The video for the song was released on June 25, 2008. On June 17, 2008, the album in it's entirety was put up on their MySpace page for listening. Shinedown's third album, The Sound of Madness, was released on June 24, 2008. The band is currently playing various festivals across North America before embarking on a tour in support of the new album.\n\nRegarding the upcoming album, lead singer Brent Smith was quoted in an interview with Billboard.com as saying; \"It's time to just go over the top, literally go above and beyond what a human being thinks they're capable of recording. We want to do a huge hard rock record that has a lot of crossover potential, but also some of the most insanely intense and heavy material that this band has ever tried - and see if we can pull it off.\" Smith noted that the group had more than forty songs to consider after writing sessions in Atlanta, Nashville and Los Angeles, but this was narrowed down to eleven songs for the standard album, and 14 songs for the deluxe edition.\n\nIn 2007 and 2008, Shinedown had some lineup changes with Brad Stewart and Jasin Todd leaving the band and Zach Myers*, Nick Perry, and Eric Bass joining the band.\n\n*Zach Myers was touring guitarist from 2005-2007 and performed as bass guitarist during the recording of The Sound of Madness.\n\nShinedown performed free concerts at numerous state fairs across the US between June and September of 2009.\n\nAccording to the Bully Songfacts, the lead single from Shinedown's fourth studio album,  Amaryllis, is titled \"Bully.\" It is the first new music to be heard from the Florida-based hard rockers since all six singles from The Sound Of Madness topped the rock radio chart. The song was released on January 3, 2012.\n\nCurrent members of the band:\nBrent Smith\nZach Myers\nEric Bass\nBarry Kerch <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Shinedown\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Bauhaus were an English rock band formed in Northampton in 1978. Known for their dark image and atmospheric sound, they are considered pioneers of gothic rock, while also incorporating elements of dub, glam rock, psychedelia, and funk. The band consisted of Daniel Ash (guitar, saxophone), Peter Murphy (vocals, occasional instruments), Kevin Haskins (drums), and David J (bass).\n\nOriginally named Bauhaus 1919 after the founding year of the German art school Bauhaus, the group shortened their name within a year of formation. Their 1979 debut single, \"Bela Lugosi's Dead,\" is regarded as a seminal track in the development of gothic rock and has influenced contemporary goth culture. Their debut album, \"In the Flat Field,\" is considered one of the first gothic rock records. The 1981 follow-up, \"Mask,\" expanded their sound with a broader range of instruments, including keyboards, saxophone, and acoustic guitar, and experimented with funk-inspired rhythms on tracks such as \"Kick in the Eye.\"\n\nBauhaus achieved mainstream success in the United Kingdom with their third album, \"The Sky's Gone Out,\" which reached number three on the UK Albums Chart in 1982. That year, their cover of David Bowie's \"Ziggy Stardust\" reached number 15 on the UK Singles Chart, earning them an appearance on \"Top of the Pops.\" During the recording of their next album, Peter Murphy fell ill and was often absent from the studio, creating tensions that led to the band's breakup on July 5, 1983, one week before the release of \"Burning from the Inside.\" The album included the Top 30 UK single \"She's in Parties\" and was their last studio album of entirely new material for 25 years.\n\nAfter Bauhaus disbanded, Murphy formed Dalis Car with bassist Mick Karn and later pursued a solo career, while Ash and Haskins continued as Tones on Tail and later reunited with David J to form Love and Rockets. Murphy and Love and Rockets achieved greater commercial success in the United States than Bauhaus. The band reunited for tours in 1998, from 2005 to 2008, and again in 2019 and 2022.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bauhaus_(band)\n\nStudio albums\nIn the Flat Field (1980)\nMask (1981)\nThe Sky's Gone Out (1982)\nBurning from the Inside (1983)\nGo Away White (2008) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Bauhaus\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Suede, known as The London Suede in the United States, is an English rock band formed in London in 1989 by singer Brett Anderson, guitarist Justine Frischmann, and bassist Mat Osman. Drawing on glam rock and post-punk influences, the band gained early attention from the British music press and were labelled \"The Best New Band in Britain\" by Melody Maker in 1992. Their debut album, \"Suede\" (1993), reached number one on the UK Albums Chart, becoming the fastest-selling debut album in nearly a decade. It won the Mercury Music Prize and was influential in the development of the Britpop movement, though the band distanced themselves from the label.\n\nThe recording of their second album, \"Dog Man Star\" (1994), was marked by internal tensions, culminating in the departure of guitarist and songwriter Bernard Butler, who was replaced by Richard Oakes before the supporting tour. Though initially a commercial disappointment, the album received positive critical reassessment over time and is regarded as a significant rock record. In 1994, Suede was recognised as part of Britpop's \"big four,\" alongside Oasis, Blur, and Pulp.\n\nFollowing the addition of keyboardist Neil Codling, Suede achieved increased commercial success with \"Coming Up\" (1996), which reached number one in the UK, produced five top ten singles, and became the band's best-selling album worldwide. Their fourth album, \"Head Music\" (1999), also topped the UK charts but received mixed critical and fan responses. Codling left the band in 2001 due to chronic fatigue syndrome and was replaced by Alex Lee. The fifth album, \"A New Morning\" (2002), released after the collapse of Nude Records, was met with limited commercial and critical success, leading to the band's disbandment in 2003. Anderson briefly reunited with Butler in 2004 to form The Tears before pursuing a solo career.\n\nSuede reunited in 2010 for a series of concerts and released their sixth album, \"Bloodsports\" (2013), which received positive reviews and returned the band to the UK top ten. Their seventh album, \"Night Thoughts\" (2016), achieved further critical and commercial success. The eighth studio album, \"The Blue Hour\" (2018), became their first top-five album since \"Head Music.\" Their ninth studio album, \"Autofiction,\" was released in September 2022, followed by their tenth album, \"Antidepressants,\" in September 2025.\n\nStudio albums\nSuede (1993)\nDog Man Star (1994)\nComing Up (1996)\nHead Music (1999)\nA New Morning (2002)\nBloodsports (2013)\nNight Thoughts (2016)\nThe Blue Hour (2018)\nAutofiction (2022)\nAntidepressants (2025)\n\n___\n\n2.

        "biografia":"GAUPA (lynx in Swedish) is a rock band from Falun, Sweden. With surreal lyrics, an energetic singer, and the sound of progressive stoner rock with doom\/folk\/psychedelic influences, they released their debut EP in June 2018 and have already established an international name on the underground scene. “GAUPA” – their self titled debut EP – was well received and the band did one of their first performances on Scandinavia’s biggest rock festival, Sweden Rock, and have been aired on different radio shows all over the world. GAUPA signed with German label Kozmik Artifactz and released the EP on vinyl in October 2019.\n\n”It’s a fabulous debut by Gaupa from Sweden, perfectly mixing stoner and psychedelic rock with folk and even some doom – which is lingering pretty subversive in a layer underneath.”\n\nMore Fuzz, Jan 2019\nGAUPA had a busy 2018\/2019 with playing at different festivals and venues. Critics seemed not only impressed by the studio recordings and diverse arrangements but also by the level of intensity displayed live. The talk in between songs are kept to a minimum and the tension are soon to be broken by another screeching guitar feedback delivered together with hair swung in fanatic synchronisation. GAUPA seem to leave their audiences both in astonishment and with a good sense of ache in their necks.\n\n“GAUPA, a Swedish stoner band from Falun starts off with an immense\nenergy right from the top. The opening song “Febersvan” takes us on a\njourney through suggestive landscapes and dark forests. The level of energy\nthey display is astounding and they keep it up for the whole set. Even in the\nslow, almost psychedelic, parts of the show, they never seem to loose any\nfocus or intensity.”\n\nStargazed Magazine (Live at Sabaton Open Air, August 2019)\nIn April 2020 GAUPA followed up to release their first full-length album “Feberdröm” gaining even more attention both from the underground scene, as well as from Nuclear Blast Records. Jens Prueter, Head Of A&R Nuclear Blast Records Europe: “While most newcomer bands struggled during the Corona pandemic, GAUPA managed to grow by quality. Their unique sound hasn’t remained unnoticed and word by mouth spread fast. Once we saw their live stream show and had some video conferences, we knew they would sit well in an artist roster of Graveyard, Opeth, Earthless and Meshuggah who appeared to be some of their favourite bands, even if GAUPA isn’t very metal at all. But it’s that attitude to tear down boundaries between genres – just for the sake of art. We are proud to welcome them in good company.” <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Gaupa\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

In 1986, La Cagaste...Burt Lancaster was released, followed by a South American tour. Hombres G disbanded after issuing their seventh album, La Historia Del Bikini, in 1992 but reunited ten years later for an international teaser tour for their 2003 release, Ano Que Vivimos Peligrosamente. ~ Drago Bonacich, All Music Guide\n\nWritten by Drago Bonacich\n\nUpdate:\nThe band reunited once again on 2005 for the release and tour of their last album \"Todo Esto Es Muy Extraño\"\nAwesome album, more mature but still spicy, though it has not been well accepted by the fans.

        "biografia":"The band started in 1984, with Marciano Cantero (bass guitar, keyboards and vocals), Felipe Staiti (guitar) and Daniel Piccolo drums. That same year, they performed throughout the Cuyo region. Later they traveled to Buenos Aires to record a demo, with unusable results that were never released. In spite of this failure, they continued doing shows in Mendoza and in Buenos Aires.\n\nIn 1984 the band added two new members: Sergio Embroni (guitar and vocals) and Tito Dávila (keyboard). As a quintet they published the disc \"Los Enanitos Verdes\", with the hit \"Aún sigo cantando\" (I'm still singing). Embrioni left the band in 1985.\n\nIn 1986 they published their second album, entitled \"Contrarreloj\" (Against the Clock), with the artistic production of Andrés Calamaro. The album included songs such as Tus viejas cartas (\"Your old letters\"), Cada vez que digo adiós (\"Every time I say goodbye\"), and La muralla verde (\"The green wall\"). Their third album \"Habitaciones extrañas\" (Strange rooms) would arrive the following year. Produced again by Calamaro, it included Te vi en un tren (\"I saw you in a train\"), Por el resto (\"For the rest\") and El extraño de pelo largo (\"The stranger with the long hair\").\n\nIn 1988 they did an extensive tour, following in the footsteps of Miguel Mateos\/Zas and Soda Stereo. During six months three particular concerts stood out: Viña del Mar (50,000 spectators), Mendoza, Argentina (35,000) and Santiago, Chile (32,000). In that same year they published their new LP, \"Carrousel\". The song \"Guitarras blancas\" (white guitars) became one of the main hits of the album. A year later the group broke up, with Marciano Cantero starting his solo career. In 1992, the group got back together, recording the album \"Igual que ayer\" (Same as Yesterday).\n\nAfter recording four more albums, in 1998 they released their album \"Tracción acústica\", with the US record company Polygram. This album made them the first Argentine group and third Argentine artist to sign with a US company. This album was nominated for the Grammies in the category \"Best Latin Rock Album.\"\n\nThey were part of the Watcha Tour 2000, which included 17 shows along with Molotov, Aterciopelados, Café Tacuba and A.N.I.M.A.L.\n\nIn 2003, they went on tour with Alejandra Guzman. They have, among other things, earned a Gaviota de Plata (Silver Gull) at the Festival de Viña del Mar in Chile. That same year they recorded their album \"Amores Lejanos\" with their hit single \"Tu Carcel\"(Your Jail) which became a classic song in all latin america, and was also sung by many great singers including Mexican composer Marco Antonio Solis. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/+noredirect\/Los+Enanitos+Verdes\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Maribou State is Chris Davids and Liam Ivory from Hertfordshire. Liam asked Chris to play bass for his band. When they moved up north to go to university, the band fell by the wayside and the pair began making electronic music in their home studio, forging a partnership that would soon become Maribou State.\n\nIn the summer of 2011 they were scouted by Fat! Records and put out their debut release, the 'Olivia' EP, which set a blueprint for Maribou State's trademark bass-heavy, melodic sound. Grassroots support for the duo was also building. When they brought out a bootleg of Lauryn Hill's 'Doo Wop' (produced in collaboration with Pedestrian), the tune racked up thousands of plays on YouTube and got airtime on Radio 1, 1Xtra and XFM courtesy of Diplo, B. Traits and Eddy Temple Morris respectively.\n\nTheir first project for Southern Fried was a remix of 'Hummus' by Crookers, which hit the top of the Hype Machine chart during the spring of 2012. Then the 'Native' EP dropped in June and one of the tracks from it, 'The Look', was promptly given 10\/10 and awarded Tune Of The Month by Mixmag. Along with underground fans, key tastemakers were beginning to take note.\n\nMomentum continued when, after a summer spent playing shows, the next single for Southern Fried was released. 'Scarlett Groove' (featuring Saint Saviour) was a certified off-kilter pop hit, notching up radio play from Annie Mac and Lauren Laverne as well as being given Essential Tune status by Pete Tong. It was an excellent way to round off 2012, a year made all the nicer when Maribou State's remix of Ultraista's 'Gold Dayzz' went viral, plonking the pair at the top of the Hype Machine chart once again and hitting over 200,000 plays on SoundCloud.\n\nTheir first major release of this year was another collaboration with Pedestrian. Signed by Polish house duo Catz 'N Dogz and put out via their Pets imprint, 'Mask' pushed Maribou State firmly to the fore of the British scene, running alongside Disclosure, Bondax and AlunaGeorge as artists dedicated to making accessible yet highly inventive dance music. The record also gained further radio play from Zane Lowe, Hugh Stephens and Rob Da Bank, as well as long-time supporters Annie Mac, B. Traits and Pete Tong.\n\nAs 2013 began to unfurl, Chris and Liam will release their latest single for Southern Fried, a record that marks the next stage of their career. A double-A side including 'Tongue' and 'Larks Rise', it sees them realise their vision of creating organic dance music in the same kind of way as Bonobo and Four Tet, forging field recordings and live instrumentation with broken house rhythms and waves of sub-bass.\n\nhttp:\/\/mariboustate.tumblr.com <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Maribou+State\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Chris Cornell (born Christopher John Boyle; July 20, 1964 - May 17, 2017), Seattle, WA, United States, was an American singer\/songwriter and guitarist.\n\nIn 1984 he formed the band Soundgarden with bassist Hiro Yamamoto. Throughout the late 1980s and 90s, Soundgarden experienced major success as one of the major grunge bands (along with groups such as Alice in Chains, Nirvana, and Pearl Jam).\n\nIn 1990, Chris Cornell worked together with the (then) Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron, and Stone Gossard, Jeff Ament and Mike McCready (who would later form Pearl Jam) in a project named Temple of the Dog. They wrote a 10 song album as a tribute to Andrew Wood, the singer of Mother Love Bone who had died the year before of a heroin overdose.\n\nIn 1997 Soundgarden split at the zenith of their popularity due to tensions in the group and Chris began a solo career. He released the sucessful album Euphoria Morning. Out of this album came the single Can't Change Me.\n\nWhen Zack De La Rocha left Rage Against The Machine in 2001, Chris Cornell joined the instrumentalists of Rage Against the Machine to form the band Audioslave.\n\nIn 2006 Chris recorded a theme song for the  James Bond 007 movie, \"Casino Royale\", titled You Know My Name, which is used as the opening song.\n\nIn the fall of 2006, Cornell started recording his second solo album Carry On, with producer Steve Lillywhite. Among some fellow artists who are expected to accompany him on his second solo release is friend and legendary musician Gary Lucas, who has contributed acoustic guitar to some of the tracks. Cornell has stated that he is always writing, and that there are some songs that he was not able to put into an Audioslave album. Carry On was released in the summer of 2007.\n\nOn February 15, 2007, Chris Cornell issued a statement that he was leaving Audioslave, shortly after Tom Morello, Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk reunited with their former vocalist Zack de la Rocha to reform Rage Against the Machine.\n\nChris Cornell released his third solo album, Scream, with American rapper and record producer Timbaland on February 3rd, 2009. This album was a critical failure, and sold poorly. It is rumored that he is going to try and \"De-Timbalandize\" the tracks. \n\nOn January 1st, 2010, Chris Cornell announced the reunion of Soundgarden after a 12 year hiatus.\n\nChris Cornell was extremely revered among the music listeners for his powerful multi-octave singing and gritty, soulful vocal style. He was a baritone with an ability to sing extremely high in the tenor range, as well as in the lower register of a baritone voice. He showcased this in various songs, most notably the studio and the demo versions of \"Beyond the Wheel\", where he can be heard spanning three octaves. He has also experimented with various different vocal styles, ranging from light falsetto to brutal screams and chants.\n\nOn May 17, 2017, Cornell died in Detroit after performing at a show with Soundgarden. He committed suicide by hanging himself in his hotel room. Footage of his final concert was posted to YouTube. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Chris+Cornell\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Car Seat Headrest is an American indie rock band formed in Leesburg, Virginia, and currently located in Seattle, Washington. The band consists of Will Toledo (vocals, guitar, piano, and synthesizers), Ethan Ives (guitar, bass, backing vocals), Seth Dalby (bass), and Andrew Katz (drums, percussion).\n\nBeginning as a solo recording project by Toledo in 2010, Car Seat Headrest self-released 12 albums on the music platform Bandcamp, before signing to Matador Records in 2015. Car Seat Headrest would begin touring as a full band the following year.\n\nHistory\n2010–2014: Lo-fi and solo releases, from 1 to How to Leave Town\nCar Seat Headrest began as the solo project of singer\/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Will Toledo (born William Barnes) shortly after he graduated high school. Toledo had previously released music under the alias Nervous Young Men, but after struggling to establish an audience, he decided to change tactics, choosing to try and release more experimental songs anonymously. Toledo chose the name \"Car Seat Headrest\" as he would often record the vocals to his early albums in the back seat of his car for privacy.\n\nThroughout the summer of 2010, Toledo released his first four albums under the Car Seat Headrest name: 1, 2, 3, and 4. 1 and 2 incorporated less traditional song structures, with stream-of-consciousness lyrics, whereas 3 and 4 would begin to cement his lo-fi indie rock style. Following the numbered albums, Toledo began attending classes at Virginia Commonwealth University, releasing the Sunburned Shirts EP during his first semester. The Sunburned Shirts EP would later be partially combined with his fifth LP, 5, to create his first titled album, My Back Is Killing Me Baby, released in March 2011. Songs culled from 5 would later appear on the b-sides compilation album Little Pieces of Paper with \"No\" Written on Them.\n\nAfter a difficult and lonely semester at VCU, Toledo transferred to the College of William & Mary, where he would release his next project, Twin Fantasy, a concept album centered on a relationship he was in at the time. Twin Fantasy would later be followed up by 2012's Monomania and Starving While Living EP.\n\nAround this time, Toledo began performing live shows with fellow students Katie Wood, Austin Ruhf, and Christian Northover, recording and releasing a short live album in July 2013 entitled Live at WCWM: Car Seat Headrest at the university's studio. Toledo would release his next project the following month; a two-hour long double album entitled Nervous Young Man. Three of the songs, and the title of the album, were taken from his original project, Nervous Young Men, but had been heavily reworked and re-recorded. Released alongside Nervous Young Man, for those who paid $5 or more, was the outtakes compilation album Disjecta Membra.\n\nToledo's final solo release was 2014's How to Leave Town, an hour long EP with heavy electronic instrumentation and more ambitious song structures.\n\n2015–2017: Matador Records, Teens of Style and Teens of Denial\nEthan Ives.\nIn September 2015, Car Seat Headrest announced on Facebook that he had signed an album deal with Matador Records. Toledo, who had recently graduated and moved to Seattle, recruited bassist Jacob Bloom and drummer Andrew Katz through Craigslist to record and tour his next album. In October 2015, Car Seat Headrest released the compilation album Teens of Style, their first to not be self-released exclusively via Bandcamp. Shortly after the album's release, Bloom left the group to attend medical school, and was replaced by bassist Ethan Ives.\n\nIves played bass throughout most of the recordings for the band's following release, but would later switch to guitar and other instruments, with Seth Dalby taking over on bass. Ives and Dalby were later cemented in these positions during live shows and future releases. The new album, created with traditional studio processes, Teens of Denial, was released on May 20, 2016. The album received universal acclaim, and brought the band a new wave of popularity.\n\nIn 2017, Car Seat Headrest released an alternate mix of their single, \"War Is Coming (If You Want It)\" through Bandcamp for one day, with profits going to the Transgender Law Center. The original mix of the track was released ten days later.\n\nOn December 13, 2017, the band released a re-recorded version of \"Beach Life-In-Death\", the second track on Twin Fantasy, through Spotify without prior announcement. This sparked fan rumors that the album would be re-recorded and released the following year. On December 27, 2017, an Amazon listing detailing a re-recorded version of Twin Fantasy was found by fans, and subsequently uploaded to the Car Seat Headrest subreddit. This was followed up by a listing on SRCVinyl.com with the date February 16, 2018. \n\n2018–2019: Twin Fantasy (Face to Face) and Commit Yourself Completely\nOn January 9, 2018, Matador Records formally announced the release of the re-recording, entitled Twin Fantasy (Face to Face), alongside a re-release of the original album. Twin Fantasy (Face to Face) was released via Matador on February 16. The original, which has been re-titled Twin Fantasy (Mirror to Mirror), was released on vinyl as a part of Record Store Day on April 21. On February 15, 2018, the band released a cover of \"Fallen Horses\" by Smash Mouth, who returned the favor by covering \"Something Soon\". Around the same time, they began touring with fellow Seattle-based band, Naked Giants, as a part of the group's expanded live lineup.\n\nIn August 2018, when asked about new material, Toledo confirmed that he was “demoing out stuff in Ableton,” adding “there might be some stuff that surprises people who only know us as a rock band, but I don’t think it will come as a surprise to people who are checking out all the deep cuts.” In January 2019, Andrew Katz confirmed the band was recording new music through a video uploaded on Instagram.\n\nFollowing the tease of new music, the band began experimenting with new material at various live shows in December 2018, debuting the tracks \"Weightlifters\", \"Hollywood\", \"Stop Lying To Me\", and \"You Know There's Someone Out There\", soon followed by \"Can't Cool Me Down\" in February and March 2019 performances. All were officially released on the next album except for \"Stop Lying To Me\" and \"You Know There's Someone Out There\".\n\nOn June 12, 2019, Car Seat Headrest announced a new live album titled Commit Yourself Completely, featuring official recordings of performances from the Twin Fantasy tour from 2018. It was released the following week on June 17.\n\n2020–present: Making a Door Less Open\nOn February 26, 2020, Car Seat Headrest announced their first studio album consisting of wholly new material since 2016's Teens of Denial, Making a Door Less Open. This announcement coincided with the release of \"Can't Cool Me Down\", the first single and second track off the album, and a release date of May 1, 2020. It marks a stylistic divergence from previous material, Toledo describing the album as containing elements of EDM, hip hop, futurism, doo-wop, soul and rock and roll. Three more singles were released to promote the album between March and April of that year: \"Martin\", \"Hollywood\" and \"There Must Be More Than Blood\". The release also coincided with the introduction of Trait, an alternative persona of Toledo's, featured prominently wearing a modified gas mask with blinking LED lights for eyes. The character had originally been created for the group's \"comedic\" side project, 1 Trait Danger, featuring Toledo alongside drummer Andrew Katz.\n\nMaking a Door Less Open was released with three separate versions across different formats: vinyl, CD and streaming, each with variations in track-list and specific musical elements. The album received a mixed reaction from fans, which pointed out the many divergences from the band's previous works, but received an overall score of 77 on review aggregate site Metacritic. Toledo noted that he and the band were working on a companion album for their latest release, while also looking for ways to improve the Trait mask to incorporate it into live performances.\n\nStyle\nAllMusic biographer Mark Deming wrote that Car Seat Headrest created \"moody and introspective lo-fi pop tunes that are melodic but structurally ambitious at once.\" Writing for Pitchfork, Jeremy Gordon stated that on Teens of Denial, \"Will Toledo reaffirms that he is ahead of the pack as an imaginative singer-songwriter, capable of crafting dynamic indie rock.\" Ian Cohen of Pitchfork also described Toledo's music as \"dense, confounding music that most often captures the giddy thrill of having access to recording equipment, of finally put a sound to the voice in your head.\"\n\nCar Seat Headrest's influences include Radiohead, Pink Floyd, the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Daniel Johnston, Destroyer, Kendrick Lamar, Frank Ocean, Leonard Cohen, of Montreal, Modest Mouse, Neutral Milk Hotel, Sufjan Stevens, Swans, They Might Be Giants, Why?, R.E.M., the Who, Nirvana, the Blackout, Neil Diamond, William Onyeabor, the Clash, the Cars, James Brown, DEVO, Queen, Rod Stewart, and Green Day. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Car+Seat+Headrest\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"All Them Witches is an explosive psychedelic trio from Nashville, Tennessee, USA Employing a heady, D.I.Y. blend of bluesy, neo-psychedelic rock, stoner metal, and progressive space rock, they emerged in 2012. The band's name is taken from a book of witchcraft, All of Them Witches, featured in the 1968 film Rosemary's Baby.\n\nNick Pipitone of Monster Riff described how the band are \"influenced just as much by Dr. John and Mississippi bluesman Junior Kimbrough as they are by Black Sabbath and progressive metal\" and that their music can \"venture from bluesy riffs and folk tales to spacey neo-psychedelic to punishing doom rock.\" Similarly, Rob Hughes of Classic Rock Magazine noted how \"[All Them Witches are] as likely to create boiling riptides of bluesy psychedelia as they are pools of mystic folk and doomy ambience.\"\n\nThe band consists of Charles Michael Parks, Jr (vocals, bass, guitar), Ben Mcleod (guitar, formerly vocals) and Robby Staebler (drums). Formed in 2012, All Them Witches were quick to release their debut, Our Mother Electricity. It consisted of a heavy blend of stoner rock-y guitars and bass, rhodes and powerful, rhythmic drums. This would set the cornerstone for their sound, soon developing into the more mysterious grooves and atmosphere on 2013's followup Lightning At The Door. This release gained real traction for the band and gave them their likely most well-known track to date, When God Comes Back. \nTaking a break from the creative front, the band released a live album in 2015, featuring a bluesy cover of Albert King's Born Under A Bad Sign. Not long after, they announced their third studio release, Dying Surfer Meets His Maker. Much like the rest of their catalogue, this album truly showcased every member's best abilities. From calm opener Call Me Star to emotional ending track Blood And Sand\/Milk And Endless Waters, the album won fans' hearts, and gained the band more well deserved attention. \nThat brings us to their 2016 live release, recorded from a show in Brussels, which contains the band playing older songs as well as another cover, being of Abner Jay's My Middle Name Is The Blues. \nKeyboardist\/violinist Allan van Cleave left the band around this time, shortly replaced by keyboardist Jonathan Draper. \nNot long after, in February 2017, they came out with another amazing record. Sleeping Through The War made quick success, being a unique, spacey album notably produced by Dave Cobb. It added dynamics and, surprisingly, more atmosphere to what was already a steadily evolving sound from such an active, young band. \n2018's self-titled ATW was announced to be the band's first release without a keyboard player, after Draper's departure. This album's characteristics include groovy stoner riffs with blues influence, slowing down and speeding up throughout the LP, ending with the haunting Rob's Dream. \n\nNearly two years later, and after a lot of touring, the band has come out with their latest record, Nothing As The Ideal, recorded at Abbey Road Studios. Harboring a sound akin to that of their single 1X1, this album is by far the group's heaviest--though it does contain softer ballads like Everest and the incredibly emotional Rats in Ruin.\n\nOn 4\/24\/2024 they announced through their Bandcamp that founding member and drummer Robby Staebler would be leaving. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/All+Them+Witches\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The band consists of Paul Banks (vocals and guitar), Sam Fogarino (drums), and Daniel Kessler (guitar and backing vocals).\n\nThe band's sound is generally a mix of staccato bass and rhythmic, harmonized guitar, with a snare heavy mix, drawing comparisons to post-punk bands such as Joy Division and The Chameleons.\n\nThe band formed in 1997 when Daniel Kessler met drummer Greg Drudy, previously a member of post-hardcore\/screamo band Joshua Fit For Battle and Hot Cross, on the New York University campus. Kessler later added Carlos D. on the bass after meeting him in a history class. The line-up was complete after Kessler ran into Paul Banks, a friend whom he had met in Paris. In 2000, Sam Fogarino, whom the band knew through his job at a local record store, replaced Drudy. Carlos Dengler, who was responsible for bass and keyboards, left the band in 2010, and hasn't been replaced, but announced various names to help them perform live.\n\nThe band released Direction on the soundtrack of the television program 'Six Feet Under' on June 28, 2005.  Shortly thereafter they left Matador for a major label.\n\nOur Love to Admire was released on July 10, 2007 in the USA (July 9 in the UK) to generally favorable reviews.  The Heinrich Maneuver was its first single.\n\nTheir self-titled LP was released on September 7th 2010 and the tracks Barricade , Summer Well , Lights , and Try It On have been issued as singles.

        "biografia":"El Último de la Fila was a successful Spanish duo based in Barcelona, Spain. Formed in 1985 by Manolo García and Quimi Portet, they released a total of 7 full-length albums before disbanding in early 1998.\n\nManolo García was the singer in a group called \"Los Rápidos\" and Quimi Portet had created a group named \"Kul de Mandril \". They started playing together in \"Los Burros\" in 1984. Then around 1985 they decided to form El Último de la Fila, becoming one of the most successful Spanish groups of the 1980s and 1990s, touring throughout Spain and Latin America. They were ranked number 1 on Rolling Stone's \"50 Greatest Spanish rock bands\".\n\nIn 1985, the two frontmen for the short-lived band, Los Burros ‒ Manolo García and Quimi Portet ‒ formed the group, El Último de la Fila. After signing with independent music label, PDI, they released their first full-length album in February 1985 titled \"Cuando la pobreza entra por la puerta, el amor salta por la ventana\".\n\nIn 1986, the band released their follow-up album, \"Enemigos de lo ajeno\", with the track, \"Insurrección\", being chosen as \"Best Song of the Year\" by Rock de Lux magazine. Enemigos de lo ajeno achieved the first Gold record, due to sales in excess of fifty thousand, for the band. 1987 saw the release of the group's third album, \"Nuevas mezclas\" ‒ recorded on a larger budget with improved sound quality ‒ followed by 1988's \"Como la cabeza al sombrero\" which sold more than 400,000 copies. The duo began performing at larger and larger concert venues throughout Europe and South America including 1988's Amnesty International Human Rights Now! concerts along with other acts such as Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Peter Gabriel, Tracy Chapman, and Youssou N'Dour. From 1988 to 1990, the group continued touring throughout Europe and the Americas including stops in Mexico, the United States, Colombia, Argentina, and Venezuela.\n\nIn 1990, the band released their fifth album, \"Nuevo pequeño catálogo de seres y estares\", which reached #1 on the AFYVE sales chart. The group also founded their own music company, Perro Records.\nAfter another extensive tour throughout Spain, Europe, and South America, the group issued its sixth album, \"Astronomía razonable\", in 1993 which became the first album by a Spanish group to stay at #1 on the AFYVE sales chart for 10 or more weeks. The disc also went gold in Venezuela and Mexico. The group promoted the album with a new international tour which included scenography designed by the Els Comediants theater group.\nIn 1995, the band released their seventh and final album, \"La rebelión de los hombres rana\", and again toured internationally in collaboration with Els Comediants. The concerts included tracks from the group's entire history including songs from the Los Rápidos and Los Burros eras.\n\nOn 13 January 1998, El Último de la Fila announced their breakup to pursue solo careers. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/+noredirect\/El+%C3%BAltimo+de+la+fila\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Marilyn Manson is an American rock band formed in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1989 by vocalist Marilyn Manson and guitarist Daisy Berkowitz. Initially performing under the name Marilyn Manson & the Spooky Kids, the group gained a local following in South Florida during the early 1990s through their theatrical and provocative live performances. In 1993, they became the first act signed to Trent Reznor’s Nothing Records label. Until 1996, each band member adopted a stage name combining the first name of a female celebrity and the last name of a male criminal, such as Marilyn Monroe and Charles Manson. The band’s lineup has changed frequently throughout its career, with Marilyn Manson remaining the sole constant member.\n\nKnown for elaborate costumes, heavy makeup, and shocking stage imagery, the band became a focus of controversy due to its lyrics and performances, which often addressed themes of religion, sexuality, violence, and drug use. Several of their concerts were met with protests, and some U.S. states enacted temporary restrictions on their performances in state-owned venues. Marilyn Manson achieved major commercial success with albums such as \"Antichrist Superstar\" (1996) and \"Mechanical Animals\" (1998), both of which were certified multi-platinum. Their visually distinctive music videos and extensive touring further cemented their prominence in rock music during the late 1990s.\n\nIn 1999, the band was falsely accused by segments of the media of influencing the perpetrators of the Columbine High School massacre, leading to widespread controversy and public debate. Although the band’s mainstream visibility declined in the following decade, Marilyn Manson continued to record and tour, maintaining a dedicated fan base.\n\nMarilyn Manson has sold over 50 million records worldwide and achieved ten top-ten albums in the United States, including two that reached number one. They have been nominated for four Grammy Awards, were inducted into the Kerrang! Hall of Fame in 2000, and were ranked 78th on VH1’s list of the 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.

        "biografia":"James Marshall \"Jimi\" Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix; November 27, 1942 – September 18, 1970) was an American rock guitarist, singer, and songwriter. Although his mainstream career spanned only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as \"arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music\".\nBorn in Seattle, Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15. In 1961, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and trained as a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division; he was granted an honorable discharge the following year. Soon afterward, he moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, and began playing gigs on the Chitlin' Circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers' backing band and later with Little Richard, with whom he continued to work through mid-1965. He then played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after being discovered by Linda Keith, who in turn interested bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals in becoming his first manager. Within months, Hendrix had earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience: \"Hey Joe\", \"Purple Haze\", and \"The Wind Cries Mary\". He achieved fame in the U.S. after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, and in 1968 his third and final studio album, Electric Ladyland, reached number one in the U.S.; it was Hendrix's most commercially successful release and his first and only number one album. The world's highest-paid performer, he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970, before his accidental death from barbiturate-related asphyxia on September 18, 1970, at the age of 27.\nHendrix was inspired musically by American rock and roll and electric blues. He favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain, and was instrumental in utilizing the previously undesirable sounds caused by guitar amplifier feedback. He helped to popularize the use of a wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock, and was the first artist to use stereophonic phasing effects in music recordings. Holly George-Warren of Rolling Stone commented: \"Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began.\"\nHendrix was the recipient of several music awards during his lifetime and posthumously. In 1967, readers of Melody Maker voted him the Pop Musician of the Year, and in 1968, Rolling Stone declared him the Performer of the Year. Disc and Music Echo honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969 and in 1970, Guitar Player named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year. The Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. Rolling Stone ranked the band's three studio albums, Are You Experienced, Axis: Bold as Love, and Electric Ladyland, among the 100 greatest albums of all time, and they ranked Hendrix as the greatest guitarist and the sixth greatest artist of all time. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Jimi+Hendrix\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \"King of Rock and Roll\" or simply \"the King\".\n\nPresley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African American music to a wider audience. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage the singer for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial.\n\nIn November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood movies and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, Aloha from Hawaii. Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate, just 42 years of age.\n\nPresley is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century. Commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel, he is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music. He won three competitive Grammys, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Elvis+Presley\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Shortly, a day after, the band announced the change of date being moved from October 16th to October 23rd due to complications caused by Covid-19, along with the announcement of a new single, \"New Invention\", that was released on October 2nd.\n\nOn September 17th, 2023, iDKHOW’s official social media accounts announced that Ryan Seaman would no longer be participating in the band due to \"a series of broken trusts,\" along with celebrating the project’s one million followers milestone on Spotify and \"Choke\" being certified Gold in US and Canada.\n\nOn October 5th, iDKHOW released their first original song in two years with \"WHAT LOVE?\", and announced their sophomore album, GLOOM DIVISION, due for release on February 23, 2024.

        "biografia":"Escape The Fate is a post-hardcore band formed in 2005 in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States. The band currently consists of Robert Ortiz (drums). Craig Mabbitt (vocals), TJ Bell (rhythm guitar, vocals), Kevin \"Thrasher\" Gruft (guitar, keyboards, vocals), and touring member Erik Jensen (bass). Ortiz is the only original member still in Escape the Fate. The band has released six studio albums: two on Epitaph, one on DGC, and three on Eleven Seven.\n\nBefore forming Escape the Fate, vocalist Ronnie Radke, bassist Max Green, drummer Robert Ortiz, lead guitarist Bryan Monte Money, and rhythm guitarist Omar Espinosa were in multiple bands together.\n\nIn September 2005, Escape the Fate had won a local radio contest judged by My Chemical Romance. The gig awarded them the opportunity to open a show on the band's headlining tour with Alkaline Trio and Reggie and the Full Effect, which subsequently led to Escape the Fate's record deal with Epitaph.\n\nOn May 23, 2006, the band released their debut EP titled There's No Sympathy for the Dead. The EP included two songs that were later on their full-length album, Dying Is Your Latest Fashion. The EP was produced by Michael Baskette and helped earn the band attention from record labels and fans alike. After the EP's release, keyboardist Carson Allen left the band to join On the Last Day.\n\nOn September 26, 2006, the band released their first full-length album, Dying Is Your Latest Fashion.\n\nIn 2007, during the Black on Black tour, rhythm guitarist Omar Espinosa left the band due to personal issues.\n\nRonnie Radke was asked to leave the band after he was sentenced to prison in June 2008 for multiple run-ins with the law involving narcotics and battery for a fight that led up to the death of Michael Cook. As stated by Max Green, \"First we couldn't tour out of the country, then out of the state.\"\n\nAfter the departure of Radke, former Blessthefall vocalist Craig Mabbitt joined the band, first as a temporary replacement, and then as a permanent member.\n\nThis War Is Ours was released on October 21, 2008. It included the singles \"The Flood\", \"Something\", \"10 Miles Wide\", and \"This War Is Ours (The Guillotine II)\". It was the first Escape the Fate album featuring Craig Mabbitt as the vocalist.\n\nEscape the Fate announced via a MySpace bulletin that they would film a video for \"This War Is Ours (The Guillotine II)\" on January 9, 2010. It was filmed at the Yost Theater in Santa Ana, California.\n\nOn February 15, 2010, Epitaph Records announced the re-release of the This War Is Ours album in deluxe CD\/DVD edition. The CD includes two new never before heard songs, later identified to be \"Bad Blood\" and \"Behind the Mask\", an acoustic version of \"Harder Than You Know\", and an unreleased remix of \"This War Is Ours (The Guillotine II)\" called \"This War Is Mine\", remixed by the Shawn Crahan. It also came with a DVD that featured the new music video to \"This War Is Ours (The Guillotine II)\", as well as \"Something\", \"The Flood\", and \"10 Miles Wide\". It also comes with a world tour documentary and a behind the music feature. It was released on April 27, 2010.\n\nIn an interview during Warped Tour 2009, Max Green stated that the album will feature a song co-written by Mick Mars of Mötley Crüe, who approached Escape the Fate to collaborate on some songs but later was revealed that they decided against putting the song on the album and saving for a future release.\n\nStarting July 24, 2010, they set off on tour for South and Central America, the country's toured are Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Colombia and Venezuela.\n\nOn July 26, 2010, Escape the Fate announced via MySpace some new updates on the album. They officially said that the new record will be released through a major record label, DGC\/Interscope, and produced by Don Gilmore (Linkin Park, Bullet For My Valentine, Hollywood Undead). Its release was set for November 2nd, 2010. Max Green commented on it, saying, \"This record is the cure for the modern-day music epidemic, We are wiping the slate clean and re-writing rock music as you know it.” Escape The Fate was set to take on a United States, Canada, and Europe tour before the release of the album, with Bullet For My Valentine, Drive A and Black Tide but later forfeited their spot due to Max Green admitting to rehab.\n\nOn August 31, 2010, the band released the album's first single, \"Massacre.\" Their second single, and first official one to be released to radio stations, \"Issues\", from the self-titled album, Escape the Fate, leaked via KROQ Radio on the 9th of September, and later officially released the single, \"Issues\", on September 15, 2010. The music video of \"Issues\", premiered on September 28 on Youtube. December 21, the next single released was \"City of Sin\" with a music video for it on Youtube.\n\nOn January 11, 2011, the band performed live in \"Tues Show\" (Fuel. tv) the song \"Issues\" and \"Gorgeous Nightmare\" with the special collaboration of Kevin Thrasher (of Lovehatehero). On June 15, 2011, the band released a music video for their next single off the self-titled album, \"Gorgeous Nightmare\". The video was directed by Robby Starbuck, who has previously worked with Asking Alexandria and Silverstein. On August 19, 2011, the band announced via Facebook that Monte Money would be taking a break from touring but will still be in the band. Kevin Thrasher, who has worked with the band in the past, will be substituting for Monte. It was also announced that Max Green returned to the band after making a breakthrough in the first half of 2011 to recover from his addiction to drugs through rehab. “I’m feeling great and am glad to be back with my band. Escape The Fate is my life. This is where I belong.”, Max Green said. After they played a couple of shows at the 2011 Uproar Festival, Max, again, left the band and Zakk Sandler, from Black Tide (who was also playing Uproar), filled in for him.\n\nTj Bell, currently bassist of getting Scared once again filled in for bassist Max Green on the bands UK tour with Funeral For A Friend, who had previously filled in for Green on their tour with Papa Roach.\n\nIn mid-December 2011, the band re-entered the studio to work on the production of their fourth album. The album will be produced by John Feldmann and is scheduled for release sometime in 2012. It is currently unknown if Max Green has returned to the band to play bass on the upcoming album or if the band hired a new bassist. However, there is much speculation as to former Motionless In White rhythm guitarist and current Get Scared bassist TJ Bell will be taking over on bass due to the band tweeting pictures of him recording in the studio, plus his recent touring history with the band filling in for Max Green.\n\nOn December 27, Craig Mabbitt posted on his official Facebook page that he will be recording music for his new side-project all through January 2012 and recording for Escape the Fate all through February. He commented that since they are recording with John Feldmann again, who they worked with on their second album, This War Is Ours, the style of the upcoming album will be similar to This War Is Ours but will also have elements of their self-titled album added in. He teased a big upcoming announcement as well.\n\nCurrent members:\nRobert Ortiz - drums, percussion, backing vocals (2004–present)\nCraig Mabbitt - lead vocals (2008–present)\nThomas \"TJ\" Bell - rhythm guitar (2013-present), bass guitar (2012-2013), (touring 2011-2012)\nKevin \"Thrasher\" Gruft - lead guitar (2013–present), (touring 2011)\nErik Jensen – bass guitar, backing vocals (touring 2017–present)\n\nFormer members:\nCarson Allen - keyboards, synthesizers, vocals (2005–2006)\nOmar Espinosa - rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2004–2007)\nRonnie Radke - lead vocals (2004–2008)\nBryan \"Monte\" Money - lead guitar, backing vocals (2004-2013)\nMichael Money - rhythm guitar (2012–2013), (touring 2008-2012)\nMax Green - bass guitar, backing vocals (2004-2012, 2013–2014)\n\nFormer touring members:\nZakk Sandler – bass guitar, backing vocals (2011)\nDavey Richmond – bass guitar (2014)\nAlex Torres – bass guitar (2014; 2015)\nTyler Burgess – bass guitar (2015)\nMax Georgiev – bass guitar, backing vocals (2015–2017)\n\nDiscography:\n1.

        "biografia":"The Neighbourhood is an American alternative rock\/dark pop band that formed in Newbury Park, California, USA in August 2011. The band consists of Jesse Rutherford, Jeremy Freedman, Zach Abels, and Mikey Margott. Brandon Fried (drums) was kicked out of the band on November 15 2022 after groping allegations. Bryan Sammis (drums) left the group in January 2014.\n\nThe band released their first EP, I'm Sorry... in January 2013, where their single Sweater Weather reached #1 in the U.S. Alternative Tracks and #8 on the U.S. Rock Tracks and #33 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song also charted at #68 in Canada. Their first album, I Love You. was released on April 23, 2013. \n\nIn early 2012 a mysterious band appeared online. The group, The Neighbourhood, revealed no biographical information, no photos and no backstory, offering only a moody track titled \"Female Robbery.\" Fans and the press were confounded, scouring the Internet for any information that might lead them to the identity of these musicians. Pieces of the puzzle, some reflecting reality and some not so much, began to emerge. The Neighbourhood were a quintet. They were from California despite the British spelling of their name. They had a second track, \"Sweater Weather,\" which had an accompanying -- and equally dark -- video.\n\nAlthough The Neighbourhood's identity remained hazy, it became clear that the music they were making felt transformative to critics and fans alike. The evocative combination of rock instruments with R&B and hip-hop aesthetics seemed, in many ways, revelatory, a reimagining of sounds that seemed to make people clamour for more information with even greater fervour. In April, BBC Radio One DJ Zane Lowe, an early champion of the group, let it slip that The Neighbourhood was the handiwork of musician Jesse Rutherford, a resident of Newbury Park, CA. By early May, as the band unveiled a free, self-released EP titled \"I'm Sorry,\" it became understood that the identity of this young band was, ultimately, secondary to the music itself.\n\nSo who is The Neighbourhood? In essence, the group, which was formed in August 2011, is a collection of five friends who make music together. They're headed by Rutherford, a 21-year-old singer who has dabbled in various genres, including hip-hop, before crafting the merge of sounds that categorizes The Neighbourhood's style. Their debut EP was produced by Justyn Pilbrow, who brought Emile Haynie on board to collaborate on \"Female Robbery.\" The EP, recorded at the end of last year, is composed of shadowy, emotional music with visuals to match. And it's all part of the band's master plan.\n\n\"I always have a strong vision before I go into anything,\" Rutherford says. \"I don't know how to make music any other way. It was all in my head, and that vision for the music was to make hip-hop beats with guitars and I was going to sing and rap over them. We wanted to do that hip-hop aesthetic on an indie platform.\"\n\n\"I'm Sorry,\" a five-song disc, is a precursor to the band's debut album, which is also being produced by Pilbrow and Haynie. The album, expected out in March 2013, will expand the group's moody sensibility, which pairs brooding layers of instrumentals with Rutherford's hip-hop-inspired croon. The style, which the band has dubbed \"black and white\" due to its confident inspirations, is based largely on rhythm, as evidenced by the EP. \"When I started in music I started doing drums and then I started doing vocals,\" Rutherford explains. \"And then I combined the two together because to me rapping is just rhythmic vocals. I think the rhythm of hip-hop is really what got me into it. It's not just words being said; it's about how the words are said.\"\n\nIn the end, all you need to know about The Neighbourhood is in that music and in those words. There are more facts, more pieces of the puzzle, more information to unveil. But what's the fun in being given the full picture when you can slowly discover it for yourself? It's better to leave some mystery lingering. Because, after all, it's that unknowing that brought The Neighbourhood to people's attention to begin with. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Neighbourhood\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool, Lancashire in 1960. With the line-up comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney,  George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, they are regarded as the most popular and influential band of all time. The group were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art form. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways; the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the group revolutionized many aspects of the music industry and were often publicized as leaders of the era's youth and socio-cultural movements. \n\nLed by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, eventually settling with Pete Best in 1960, who played with them for two years before being replaced with then Rory Storm & The Hurricanes drummer Ringo Starr in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein molded them into a professional act and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed \"Beatlemania\", the band acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\", with Epstein, Martin and other members of the band's entourage sometimes given the informal title of \"fifth Beatle\".\n\nBy early 1964, the Beatles were international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market and breaking numerous sales records. They soon made their film debut with A Hard Day's Night (1964). From 1965 onwards, they produced increasingly innovative recordings, including the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and enjoyed further commercial success with The Beatles (also known as \"the White Album\", 1968) and Abbey Road (1969). In 1968, they founded Apple Corps, a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After the group's break-up in 1970, all four members enjoyed success as solo artists. Lennon was shot and killed in December 1980, and Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.\n\nThe Beatles are the best-selling music act of all time, with estimated sales of 600 million units worldwide. They hold the record for most number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart, most number-one hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and most singles sold in the UK. The group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and all four main members were inducted individually between 1994 and 2015. In 2008, the group topped Billboard's list of the all-time most successful artists on the Billboard Hot 100. The band received seven Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 film Let It Be) and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. Time magazine named them among the 20th century's 100 most important people.\n\nFormer Rolling Stone associate editor Robert Greenfield compared the Beatles to Picasso, as \"artists who broke through the constraints of their time period to come up with something that was unique and original \"... In the form of popular music, no one will ever be more revolutionary, more creative and more distinctive ...\" The British poet Philip Larkin described their work as \"an enchanting and intoxicating hybrid of African-American rock-and-roll with their own adolescent romanticism\", and \"the first advance in popular music since the War\".\n\nThey not only sparked the British Invasion of the US, they became a globally influential phenomenon as well. From the 1920s, the US had dominated popular entertainment culture throughout much of the world, via Hollywood films, jazz, the music of Broadway and Tin Pan Alley and, later, the rock and roll that first emerged in Memphis, Tennessee. The Beatles are regarded as British cultural icons, with young adults from abroad naming the band among a group of people that they most associated with UK culture.\n\nTheir musical innovations and commercial success inspired musicians worldwide. Many artists have acknowledged the Beatles' influence and enjoyed chart success with covers of their songs. On radio, their arrival marked the beginning of a new era; in 1968 the programme director of New York's WABC radio station forbade his DJs from playing any \"pre-Beatles\" music, marking the defining line of what would be considered oldies on American radio. They helped to redefine the album as something more than just a few hits padded out with \"filler\", and they were primary innovators of the modern music video. The Shea Stadium show with which they opened their 1965 North American tour attracted an estimated 55,600 people, then the largest audience in concert history; Spitz describes the event as a \"major breakthrough ... a giant step toward reshaping the concert business\". Emulation of their clothing and especially their hairstyles, which became a mark of rebellion, had a global impact on fashion.\n\nAccording to Gould, the Beatles changed the way people listened to popular music and experienced its role in their lives. From what began as the Beatlemania fad, the group's popularity grew into what was seen as an embodiment of socio-cultural movements of the decade. As icons of the 1960s counterculture, Gould continues, they became a catalyst for bohemianism and activism in various social and political arenas, fuelling movements such as women's liberation, gay liberation and environmentalism. According to Peter Lavezzoli, after the \"more popular than Jesus\" controversy in 1966, the Beatles felt considerable pressure to say the right things and \"began a concerted effort to spread a message of wisdom and higher consciousness\".\n\n\nOther commentators such as Mikal Gilmore and Todd Leopold have traced the inception of their socio-cultural impact earlier, interpreting even the Beatlemania period, particularly on their first visit to the US, as a key moment in the development of generational awareness. Referring to their appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show Leopold states: \"In many ways, the Sullivan appearance marked the beginning of a cultural revolution ... The Beatles were like aliens dropped into the United States of 1964.\"\n\nIn 1965, Queen Elizabeth II appointed Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). The Beatles won the 1971 Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for the film Let It Be (1970). The recipients of seven Grammy Awards and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards, the Beatles have six Diamond albums, as well as 20 Multi-Platinum albums, 16 Platinum albums and six Gold albums in the US. In the UK, the Beatles have four Multi-Platinum albums, four Platinum albums, eight Gold albums and one Silver album. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.\n\nThe best-selling band in history, the Beatles have sold more than 800 million physical and digital albums as of 2013. They have had more number-one albums on the UK charts, fifteen, and sold more singles in the UK, 21.9 million, than any other act. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the Beatles as the most significant and influential rock music artists of the last 50 years. They ranked number one on Billboard magazine's list of the all-time most successful Hot 100 artists, released in 2008 to celebrate the US singles chart's 50th anniversary. As of 2017, they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Billboard Hot 100, with twenty. The Recording Industry Association of America certifies that the Beatles have sold 178 million units in the US, more than any other artist. They were collectively included in Time magazine's compilation of the 20th century's 100 most influential people. In 2014, they received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nThere are two holidays celebrated for the Beatles: Global Beatles Day on 25 June each year. On that date in 1967, the band performed \"All You Need Is Love\" on television. In 2001, UNESCO created World Beatles Day on 16 January each year. This date has direct relation to the opening of The Cavern Club in 1957.\n\nFive asteroids, 4147 Lennon, 4148 McCartney, 4149 Harrison, 4150 Starr and 8749 Beatles are named after the Beatles. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Beatles\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Smith has been the sole constant member throughout the group’s history, while Gallup has appeared on all but two of the band’s studio albums.\n\nThe Cure’s debut album \"Three Imaginary Boys\" (1979), along with several early singles, established them as a leading act in the emerging post-punk and new wave scenes in the United Kingdom. With their second album \"Seventeen Seconds\" (1980), the band developed a darker, more atmospheric sound that became influential in the formation of gothic rock. This stylistic direction continued through albums such as \"Faith\" (1981) and \"Pornography\" (1982). Following \"Pornography,\" Smith began to integrate more melodic and pop-oriented elements into the band’s music, broadening their appeal and leading to international commercial success.\n\nThe Cure reached their greatest mainstream popularity with the albums \"Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me\" (1987), \"Disintegration\" (1989), and \"Wish\" (1992), recorded with guitarist Porl Thompson and drummer Boris Williams.

        "biografia":"Guns N' Roses is an American hard rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1985 from members of L.A. Guns and Hollywood Rose. After signing with Geffen Records in 1986, the group’s classic lineup consisted of vocalist Axl Rose, lead guitarist Slash, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin, bassist Duff McKagan, and drummer Steven Adler.\n\nThe band developed a following in Los Angeles before releasing its debut album, \"Appetite for Destruction\" (1987). The album initially gained limited attention until the success of the music video for \"Welcome to the Jungle.\" \"Appetite for Destruction\" went on to sell more than 30 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling debut album in the United States, and produced successful singles including \"Paradise City\" and \"Sweet Child o’ Mine.\" The follow-up album, \"G N' R Lies\" (1988), combined new acoustic material with earlier recordings. It reached number two on the Billboard 200, sold around ten million copies worldwide, and featured the hit \"Patience\" along with the controversial track \"One in a Million.\" In 1990, Matt Sorum replaced Adler, and keyboardist Dizzy Reed joined the group.\n\nThe band released two albums simultaneously in 1991: \"Use Your Illusion I\" and \"Use Your Illusion II.\" They debuted at number two and number one on the Billboard 200 and sold a combined total of approximately 35 million copies worldwide. These albums produced singles such as \"You Could Be Mine,\" \"Don't Cry,\" and \"November Rain,\" noted for high-budget music videos. After completing the Use Your Illusion Tour (1991–1993), Guns N' Roses released the punk covers album \"The Spaghetti Incident?\" (1993).\n\nDuring the mid-1990s and early 2000s, the band experienced extensive lineup changes. By 1998, Rose and Reed remained as the only members from the Use Your Illusion era. New members, including Robin Finck, Buckethead, Tommy Stinson, Brain, and Chris Pitman, worked on the long-delayed album \"Chinese Democracy\" (2008). Production costs for the album were widely reported as high, and it became one of the most expensive rock albums made. Geffen released the compilation \"Greatest Hits\" in 2004, which remained on the Billboard 200 for an extended period. The current lineup includes Rose, Slash, McKagan, Richard Fortus, Isaac Carpenter, Reed, and Melissa Reese.\n\nGuns N' Roses has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and is considered one of the best-selling musical acts. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012. In 2016, Slash and McKagan rejoined the band for the Not in This Lifetime... Tour, which became one of the highest-grossing concert tours. Guns N' Roses is known for energetic performances, media controversies, and a musical style that blends elements of punk, blues, and metal, contributing to a shift in late-1980s rock away from glam rock.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Guns_N%27_Roses\n\nStudio albums\nAppetite for Destruction (1987)\nG N' R Lies (1988)\nUse Your Illusion I (1991)\nUse Your Illusion II (1991)\n\"The Spaghetti Incident?\" (1993)\nChinese Democracy (2008) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Guns+N%27+Roses\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Disturbed is an American alternative metal band from Chicago, Illinois, formed in 1994. The band includes vocalist David Draiman, bassist John Moyer, guitarist\/keyboardist Dan Donegan, and drummer Mike Wengren. Former band members are vocalist Erich Awalt and bassist Steve Kmak.\n\nThe band has released six studio albums, five of which have consecutively debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Disturbed went into hiatus in October 2011, during which the band's members focused on various side projects, and returned in June 2015, releasing their first album in four years, Immortalized, on August 21, 2015. They also recorded and released one live album, Disturbed: Live at Red Rocks on November 18, 2016, which was recorded on August 18, 2016 at Red Rocks Amphitheater in Morrison, Colorado, located about 10 miles west of Denver, Colorado. Their seventh studio album, Evolution, was released on October 19, 2018.\n\nBefore David Draiman joined Disturbed, guitarist Dan Donegan, drummer Mike Wengren, and bassist Steve \"Fuzz\" Kmak were in a band called Brawl with vocalist Erich Awalt. Before changing their name to \"Brawl\", however, Donegan mentioned in the band's DVD, Decade of Disturbed, that the name was originally going to be \"Crawl\"; they switched it to \"Brawl\", due to the name already being used by another band. Awalt left the band shortly after the recording of a demo tape; the other three members advertised for a singer. They posted an advertisement in the local music publication in Chicago, Illinois, called the \"Illinois Entertainer\". Draiman answered the advertisement after going to twenty other auditions that month. Guitarist Dan Donegan commented on Draiman: \"You know, out of all the singers that we had talked to or auditioned, he [Draiman] was the only singer who was ready to go with originals. And that impressed me, just to attempt that\".\n\nWith regard to Draiman being the singer for the band, Donegan said, \"After a minute or two, he just starts banging out these melodies that were huge...I'm playing my guitar and I'm grinning from ear to ear, trying not to give it away that I like this guy, you know, because I don't want to, you know...[say] 'Yeah, we'll give you a call back. We'll, you know, discuss it.' But I was so psyched. Chill up my spine. I'm like, 'There is something here.'\" As drummer Mike Wengren commented, \"We clicked right off the bat.\" Draiman then joined the band in 1996 and the band was renamed Disturbed. When asked in an interview why he suggested to name the band \"Disturbed,\" Draiman said, \"It had been a name I have been contemplating for a band for years. It just seems to symbolize everything we were feeling at the time. The level of conformity that people are forced into was disturbing to us and we were just trying to push the envelope and the name just sorta made sense.\n\nDisturbed headlined the 2018 Rock Fest, along with Godsmack and Incubus. The band announced via social media in early January of 2018 that they had entered the studio to begin recording their next studio album. In June 2018 lead guitarist Dan Donegan and bassist John Moyer confirmed with sources that the new album is complete, with 100% of the songs finished it is on to just mixing and mastering. Band members also posted a picture via Instagram together at a dinner party in celebration of completion of the recording process. The band's first album in over 3 years and the band’s first album in over 8 years to have bassist John Moyer being involved in.\n\nThe album, Evolution was released on October 19, 2018. On August 16, 2018, the lead single, titled \"Are You Ready\" was released. On September 21, 2018, the album's second single, titled \"A Reason to Fight\" was released.\n\nDisturbed's mascot, named \"The Guy\", was originally just a drawing of a face with a large grin, as seen on the back of the album The Sickness. The original drawing of The Guy was then edited using a digital distorting program. After the original image had been distorted three times The Guy became the official mascot for the band. Later, he would be drawn as a full figure by artist David Finch.\n\nClassified as a heavy metal or hard rock band, Disturbed is also regarded by some critics as nu metal and alternative metal. When asked about die-hard heavy metal fans not finding Disturbed heavy enough, Draiman at one time stated:\n\n\"We probably have too much melody going on or we're not quite as turbulent or caustic. While I really love that type of music, it's not what we try to do. If we have to place things in context, we're more hard rock than heavy metal these days. The secret is that we were never really part of any particular trend, although we definitely benefited from the popularity of what was called nu metal at the time ... We never had the stereotypical attributes that those bands had. We don’t rap; there’s no turntable involved; no fusion in that respect. We play, in my opinion, classic metal. Sabbath, Maiden, Priest, Metallica, Pantera: these are the bands that made us want to play.\"\n\nThey have often cited their influences as Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Metallica, Pantera, Iron Maiden, Led Zeppelin, Queensryche, Nirvana, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden.\n\nGuitarist Dan Donegan uses guitar tunings Drop C, Drop C# and Drop B (also occasionally Eb), which are lower tunings than regular E standard. These lower tunings allow for a heavier sound and quicker chord changes in Donegan's riffs. Donegan also uses subtle electronic effects, which the rest of the band refers to as \"The Danny Donegan Orchestra\". <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Disturbed\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

She moved to Santiago, Chile in 1993, where she's stayed.\n\nIn the 1990's Anita formed a hip-hop band Los Gemelos (The Twins) with a fellow rapper Zaturno (later became famous as a member of Tiro de Gracia). In 1997 she gained first major attention after singing in a Los Tetas' hit single \"La Medicina\". Later she joined DJ Squat, Cenzi and Seo2, and Makiza was formed.\n\nAfter Makiza went on hiatus in 2001, Anita returned to France and took a break from music until 2004. After coming back to Chile in 2004 she became singing with the funk\/acid jazz band Aluzinati, and later in 2005 she reformed Makiza with Seo2 and two new members and released the band's final album to date, Casino Royale.\n\nIn 2007 Anita appeared on Julieta Venegas' hit single, \"Eres Para Mí\" and finally released her solo debut, Kaos. Thanks to the first single, \"Despabílate\", Anita was nominated for the Latin version of the MTV Video Music Awards 2007 under the categories Best New Artist and Best Urban Artist.\n\nIn October 2009, Tijoux released her second solo album, titled 1977 after the year she was born. The album was a return to her rap roots, an homage to the \"golden age of hip-hop\"; it was largely auto-biographical, exploring mature themes from her own life, from the death of a close friend to having a creative crises, from friendship to bad luck, amongst others. It was simple and straight to the point, as emphasized by her leaving behind a lot of the singing she had been doing of late in other more pop collaborations, and concentrating on rap, both in Spanish and French. After years of sharing the spotlight with her group, collaborating with other artists, and trying to find her way as a solo artist, she has finally arrived in her own right—a raw, direct, and mature MC.\nRecorded between May and September 2009, the new album was produced by Hordatoj, Foex and Tee, of the label Potoco Discos, together with Habitación del Pánico. Guests on the record include the saxophonist Agustín Moya with whom she worked with in Aluzinati, Andrés Celis, Solo Di Medina, Bubaseta, Stailok from the group Movimiento Original, DJ Dacel, Quique Neira (formerly from Gondwana), Cómo Asesinar A Felipes, and the Detroit-based MC Invincible, whom she met over MySpace and did a virtual collaboration for the song \"Sube\".\nThe album and its first single 1977 were an immediate hit in the underground rap circles of Chile, where she was welcomed back after a bit of a stray. The record was amongst the top 10 of 2009 for the blog [worldhiphopmarket.com], and it was soon picked up by the U.S.-based Latin Alternative label Nacional Records, who released it in April 2010. She was invited to attend the prestigious South By South West Music Festival in Austin, Texas, in March 2010, and from there went on to her first ever North American tour. The song 1977 is featured in FIFA 11 soundtrack, and it also appears in episode five of the fourth season of Breaking Bad.\n\nIn 2011 Ana released her new solo album, La Bala. The album deals with many political and social issues in  Chile, and the lead single, \"Shock\", was inspired by the strikes of the Chilean students which took part in 2011.\n\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Ana+Tijoux\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Like his older sister, singer\/songwriter Heather Nova (born Heather Frith), pop-reggae singer Mishka grew up at sea, traveling from island to island in the West Indies on his Canadian mother and Bermudian father's sailboat, where he received most of his education and listened to whatever music he could. When his parents returned to Canada, he completed school and returned to the Caribbean, eventually becoming a competitive windsurfer and representing Bermuda at international meets. In the meantime, he had also taken up songwriting, and he chanced to meet and impress Creation Records head Alan McGee with his vocal ability in late 1996; with prodding from Nova, Mishka was signed to a record contract the following year. His eponymous debut album, a mix of pop, reggae, soul, and singer\/songwriter folk-rock, was released in 1999. \n\nThe other Mishka is from Ireland, currently living in America. Fronted by Lauren Norton. They have one EP - 47 Varieties Of Hindsight. Myspace: www.myspace.com\/mihskamusik <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Mishka\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The band was notable for their music and their live shows, featuring lavish historical costumes and stage sets, with short silent theater pieces preluding various songs.\n\nFormed by guitarists Mana and Közi, throughout their history, the band has gone through several different lineups and three drastic image changes, with Mana, Kozi, and bassist Yu~ki being the band's sole consistent members. Their earlier music and themes were characterized by their strong French and classical influences, later moving away from deliberate French romanticism and incorporating Gothic aspects after several difficulties befell the band.\n\nAt their peak in the mid-to-late 1990s, they were considered one of the \"Four Heavenly Kings of visual kei\" alongside La'cryma Christi, Fanatic Crisis and Shazna. Their third and most successful studio album Merveilles (1998) was included in 2021 by Kerrang! on a list of 13 essential Japanese rock and metal albums. However, their success was short-lived, and in late 2001 it was announced that Malice Mizer would go on an indefinite hiatus.

        "biografia":"Dire Straits were a British rock band formed in London in 1977 by Mark Knopfler (lead vocals and lead guitar), David Knopfler (rhythm guitar and backing vocals), John Illsley (bass guitar and backing vocals), and Pick Withers (drums and percussion). They were active from 1977 to 1988 and again from 1990 to 1995.\n\nTheir first single, \"Sultans of Swing\", from their 1978 self-titled debut album, reached the top ten in the UK and US charts. It was followed by a series of hit singles including \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1981), \"Private Investigations\" (1982), \"Twisting by the Pool\" (1983), \"Money for Nothing\" (1985), and \"Walk of Life\" (1985). Their most commercially successful album, \"Brothers in Arms\" (1985), has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide; it was the first album to sell a million copies on compact disc (CD) and is the eighth-best-selling album in UK history. According to the Guinness Book of British Hit Albums, Dire Straits have spent over 1,100 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, the fifth most of all time.\n\nDire Straits' sound drew from various influences, including country, folk, the blues rock of J. J. Cale, and jazz. Their stripped-down sound contrasted with punk rock and demonstrated a roots rock influence that emerged from pub rock. There were several changes in personnel, with Mark Knopfler and Illsley being the only members who remained with the band for its whole history. After their first breakup in 1988, Mark Knopfler told Rolling Stone: \"A lot of press reports were saying we were the biggest band in the world. There's not an accent then on the music, there's an accent on popularity. I needed a rest.\" They disbanded for good in 1995, after which Knopfler launched a solo career full-time. He has since declined numerous reunion offers.\n\nDire Straits were called \"the biggest British rock band of the 80s\" by Classic Rock magazine; their 1985–1986 world tour, which included a performance at Live Aid in July 1985, set a record in Australasia. Their final world tour from 1991 to 1992 sold 7.1 million tickets. Dire Straits won four Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards (Best British Group twice), two MTV Video Music Awards, and various other awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018. Dire Straits have sold between 100 and 120 million units worldwide, including 51.4 million certified units, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dire_Straits\n\nDiscography\nDire Straits (1978)\nCommuniqué (1979)\nMaking Movies (1980)\nLove over Gold (1982)\nBrothers in Arms (1985)\nOn Every Street (1991) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Dire+Straits\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The duo started writing together after Kendrick had laid down a few demo vocal tracks and asked Banjanin to flesh them out.

A year later, after a barrage of singles, the band released their sophomore LP, My Resignation.\n\nIn December 2022, Kendrick announced that Toma Banjanin would be taking a step back from Geowulf, effectively turning it into Kendrick's solo project.

They immediately started working on arrangements for some of Josh's songs. Later Josh met lead guitarist and vocalist Jonas Swanson while waiting in line for an open mic at the Velour in Provo city. Neither of them got on the list to play that night, so they sat on a park bench outside the venue and played their songs to each other until they ran out of stuff to play. Josh invited Jonas to come down and play with him and Juice. It was that night that Out of Tune, a song Josh had been holding onto since he was 16, came to life when they arranged it as a group.   In spring of 2018 the band began recording together. They released their self produced EP Elevator Days on June 3, 2018 and played their first show a few short weeks after.  They released their first full length LP, When We Were Friends on January 27th, 2019.   The group is currently writing new material that they say is a product of the co-writing chemistry that has grown between Jonas & Joshua since their friendship began. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Backseat+Lovers\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The critical reception was generally good, receiving good reviews from NME, Q magazine and Billboard, although they were also accused of lack of imagination and unoriginality for allegedly borrowing ideas from other influential bands, notably The Strokes. They appear to polarize opinion. NME wrote that the album: \"bristles with passion, energy and, most importantly, amazing songs\", while they were described elsewhere as \"nearly everything wrong with rock and roll today\". Their fans, though, embrace the music for its simple melodies and multi-layered, easy-going compositions.\n\nFrontman Johnny Borrell caused some controversy and surprise when he likened himself to musical legend Bob Dylan, quipping \"If Dylan's making the chips then I'm drinking the champagne\". This led to suggestions of self-promotion. This statement was taken out of context however as Borrell was comparing his and Dylan's first albums, not their overall career. The band became very popular on the London music scene when they arrived earlier in the year. Large demand caused the band to play extra shows, including a 7,000+ capacity gig at Alexandra Palace. The album was heavily marketed in the UK. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Razorlight\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Memphis May Fire is a metalcore band with southern rock influences (previously post-hardcore) currently based in Dallas, Texas. The band formed in December 2006, but it was not until February 2007 that the group decided on the name Memphis May Fire having previously gone by \"O Captain, My Captain!\". Since its formation, the band has released two EPs and six full-length albums, the latest being Shapeshifter which was released in March 2025.\n\nIn early 2007, the band recorded and self-released an EP, and began creating a local following. Shortly thereafter, Memphis May Fire caught the attention of Josh Grabelle, the president of Trustkill Records. In September 2007 the band had officially signed to Trustkill, and their self-titled EP (Memphis May Fire) was reissued through the label in December 2007.\n\nMemphis May Fire hoped to release their debut album by summer 2008, however, during the recording sessions for the album, lead singer Chase Ryan decided to leave the band. Chase explained that he felt that his priorities should be with his newborn child and not a band. Upon announcing his resignation, bass player Austin Radford also decided to part ways with the band shortly thereafter. He would be replaced by Cory Elder. Open auditions were held shortly after Chase's departure, and he was eventually replaced by a new vocalist, Matty Mullins. By this time, Memphis May Fire had already recorded their instruments for the new album with producer Casey Bates and only needed Mullins to contribute his vocals.\n\nTheir debut full-length studio album, Sleepwalking, was released on July 21, 2009, through Trustkill Records. Memphis May Fire has described the album as \"a new breed of rock n' roll\" and musically it has \"more aggressive guitar work and noticeably more melodic, but still retains that southern swagger.\" Their song \"Ghost in the Mirror\" was used on the soundtrack for the movie Saw VI.\nThe official music video for \"Ghost in the Mirror\" was released on February 2nd, 2010 through the Trustkill YouTube page.\n\nMemphis May Fire released a second EP entitled Between the Lies on November 2, 2010, through Bullet Tooth Records with more energy and a different style than their previous releases. On December 9, 2010 the band post in their Facebook that the song \"Action\/Adventure\" will be featured in the video game Rock Band 3. In 2010, Matty Mullins was featured in the song \"That's What She Said\", from Kid Liberty's debut album Fight with Your Fists.\n\nOn January 17, 2011, Rise Records announced Memphis May Fire signed to the label and that a new album will be released in spring. The band recently wrapped up the recording of their upcoming full-length record at Chango Studios (Of Machines, I See Stars, Sleeping with Sirens, etc.) in Orlando, Florida.\n\nOn March 3, 2011, a full album teaser for their sophomore album The Hollow was released via Rise Records YouTube page, including its release date of April 26, 2011. On March 22, a full song from The Hollow, titled \"The Sinner\", was released to Rise Records YouTube page and on iTunes. On April 23, the entire album was released on the Rise Records YouTube page.\n\nOn September 15th, the video for the lead single from The Hollow, \"The Sinner\", directed by Thunder Down Country was released on YouTube.\nOn February 15th, 2012, a live music video recorded in Orlando Florida for the song titled \"The Unfaithful\" was released on their YouTube Page.\n\nOn February 11th it was announced by Kellen McGregor that the band will be working with Cameron Mizell shortly again, to record their third studio album, Challenger. The album was released June 26th, 2012 through Rise Records while the band is on Warped Tour. On April 11th around midnight, Ryan Bentley announced he has parted ways with the band in a tweet saying \"I'm no longer in Memphis May Fire. Details later.\" On April 17th, the band announced that Anthony Sepe (ex-Decoder) would be replacing Ryan Bentley as their new guitarist:\n\n\"For those who may not know already, we recently decided to part ways with our guitarist, Ryan Bentley, and wish him nothing but the best. He's a talented individual and we have no doubt that he will be successful no matter where life leads him. With that said, we'd like all of you to give a warm welcome to our new guitarist Anthony Sepe.\"\n\nOn March 25, 2014, their album Unconditional was released. On October 28, 2016, the band released the album This Light I Hold and on November 16, 2018, the album Broken was released, these last three all through Rise Records.\n\nOn June 3rd, 2022, MMF released the album Remade in Misery through Rise Records.\n\nCurrent members:\nKellen McGregor – lead guitar, backing vocals, programming, keyboard (2006–present), lead vocals (2006)\nMatty Mullins – lead vocals (2008–present)\nCory Elder – bass (2008–present)\nJake Garland – drums, percussion (2010–present)\n\nTouring members:\nSamuel Penner – rhythm guitar (2017–2019)\nLucas Chandler – rhythm guitar (2021–present)\n\nFormer members:\nTanner Oakes – bass (2006–2008)\nRyan Dooley – drums (2006–2007)\nChase Ryan Robbins – lead vocals (2006–2008)\nJeremy Grisham – drums (2007–2009)\nAustin Radford – bass (2008–2009)\nDaniel De Los Santos – bass (2008)\nJoel Seier – rhythm guitar (2009–2010)\nEric Molesworth – drums (2009–2010)\nRyan Bentley – rhythm guitar (2006–2009, 2010–2012)\nAnthony Sepe – rhythm guitar (2012–2017) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Memphis+May+Fire\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Fiona Boyes is one of the best fingerstyle blues guitarists on the planet. From Melbourne in Australia, but now resident in Portland Oregon, Fiona stands securely at a relatively young age among the new breed of blues players. She was the first woman and first Australian to win the solo\/duo section of the Memphis International Blues Challenge.Her electric blues big band album Lucky 13 was a finalist in the International Blues Challenge in 2007.\n\nHer big voice, her strong support of blues traditions and her distinctive style of playing make her one of the emerging greats of the blues.\n\nHighly recommended are Blues In My Heart, an early acoustic blues album. and Lucky 13, a deliciously loose electric blues album.\nFiona Boyes has made a name for herself on the blues circuit, but when it comes to the specific types of blues that she performs, the Australian singer\/guitarist\/songwriter has not been the least bit easy to categorize or pigeonhole apart from saying that she is blues-oriented. Listening to Boyes for an hour or even half-an-hour, one is likely to hear a very wide variety of blues or blues-related styles. Texas blues, Chicago blues, Louisiana swamp blues, Memphis blues, and Mississippi Delta blues are all fair game for Boyes, who is as comfortable rocking out and embracing electric urban blues as she is playing acoustic guitar and embracing down-home country blues.\nBoyes has never been a blues purist or a staunch blues traditionalist; rock & roll, soul, and jazz have influenced her work, and she obviously doesn't believe that a blues artist is obligated to favor a 12-bar format 100-percent of the time. But whatever she does — whether she is getting into jump blues, early R&B, blues-soul, rockabilly, or '20s- and '30s-style classic female blues of the Bessie Smith\/Ma Rainey\/Victoria Spivey variety — Boyes' work is always blues-related in some fashion. The artists Boyes has frequently found herself compared to include Bonnie Raitt, Marcia Ball, Susan Tedeschi, Lou Ann Barton, and Rory Block. Raitt, in fact, has been a major influence on Boyes, although Boyes' gritty work has a lot more in common with the Raitt of the '70s than with the sleeker, more polished and pop-minded Raitt of the late '80s, '90s and 2000s. But Raitt is only one of the countless artists who has had an impact on Boyes. An incredibly wide variety of artists has affected the eclectic Aussie to some degree, ranging from Smith, Rainey, Spivey, and Memphis Minnie to John Lee Hooker to Chicago-associated icons such as Willie Dixon, Buddy Guy, Howlin' Wolf, Koko Taylor, and Muddy Waters. Boyes obviously cherishes the Mississippi Delta country-blues of Robert Johnson and Son House, and she hasn't escaped the influence of Jimi Hendrix or Janis Joplin, either.\nBoyes was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia, where she started making her presence felt in blues circles in the late '80s. It was in 1990 that Boyes and four other Australian women formed an all-female blues band called the Mojos, who recorded five albums in the '90s (The Mojos in 1990, Hardheaded Woman in 1991, Sassy Mama in 1995, Mumbo Gumbo in 1996 and Swing O'Clock Blues in 1999) and acquired a small following Down Under (the Mojos that Boyes was a part of shouldn't be confused with a British Invasion rock group of the '60s). But Boyes became a full-time solo artist in 2000, providing her first solo album, Blues in My Heart, that year; the acoustic Blues in My Heart was followed by Gimme Some Sweet Jelly Roll in 2003 and Live in Atlanta in 2004. In the mid-2000s, Boyes signed with the Memphis-based Yellow Dog label, which released Lucky 13 in 2006 and Blues Woman in 2009.\n\nWebsite: Fiona Boyes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Fiona+Boyes\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman on May 24, 1941 in Duluth, Minnesota, United States)  is an American songwriter, poet, guitarist, and singer. Often regarded as one of the greatest songwriters of all time, Dylan has been a major figure in popular culture during a career spanning more than 60 years.\n\nDylan started his musical odyssey in 1959 when he began playing in Dinkytown, Minneapolis while attending the University of Minnesota. Shortly after starting to play he changed his stage name to Bob Dylan, after being influenced by the poetry of Dylan Thomas before legally changing his name in 1962. \n\nMuch of his best known work is from the 1960s, when he became an informal documentarian and reluctant figurehead of American unrest, promoted by Joan Baez. Some of his songs, such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"The Times They Are A-Changin'\", became anthems of the anti-war and civil rights movements, with Joan Baez and Dylan singing together at the March on Washington in 1963. However he later became disenchanted with the civil liberty protest scene, feeling that he had been used by them.\n\nHis album Bringing It All Back Home marked a move away from the folk scene and a move towards rock and roll and Dylan began to consciously distance himself from his early association with civil rights. He also started to become irritated when being interviewed, often given facetious or irreverent answers to questions. Bringing It All Back Home was a controversial album as it the first on which he played electric guitar. This was seen by some of his fans as a betrayal of this folk roots, with some saying that it obscured his meaningful and poetic lyrics.\n\nThe second half of the 1960s was marked by a string of well received releases, with his song \"Like a Rolling Stone\", released in July of 1965, later being named \"The Greatest Song of All Time\" by Rolling Stone magazine in 2004, placing #1 in a list of 500 titles. It also marked the formation of Dylan's backing band The Hawks (who would later call themselves simply The Band). Dylan embarked on a world tour of Australia and Europe in 1966, during which he seemed to be under a lot of strain and pressure by both his fans, the music press and his own promoters. Dylan himself admitted that he began taking drugs seriously whilst on this tour, and found it immensely hard work. On returning to New York he crashed his motorbike, sustaining serious injuries in the process, and went into a period of withdrawal while he recuperated. During the late 1960s, Dylan again changed stylistic tradition, moving away from the psychedelic culture of the time. It was then that he recorded All Along the Watchtower, perhaps more famously recorded by Jimi Hendrix.\n\nThe 1970s were a period during which Dylan was more sporadic in his output, releasing some poorly received LPs. He rarely appeared in person until 1974, when he began touring again with his backing band The Band. He also wrote one of his most extensively covered songs, Knockin' On Heaven's Door, as well as what is now recognised as one of his best albums Blood On The Tracks. Towards the end of the 1970s, Dylan discovered Christ, and released some albums of gospel music. He started to talk to the crowd about his faith during his performances, and wouldn't play any of his early work, which alienated some of his previous fans.\n\nDylan today still remains an influential and popular artist; despite a period of little note between 1980-2000, his 2006 album Modern Times reached the US chart at #1, as did his 2009 album Together Through Life, in the US, Britain, France and several other countries. His 2012 album Tempest was also critically acclaimed. Since 1988, Dylan has been on the so-called Never Ending Tour, during which his performances have provoked controversy, with some critics claiming that his lyrics have become incomprehensible, an experience which is not helped by his tendency to change his set-list and vocals almost every performance.\n\nBob Dylan's strong influence over the past few years is becoming even more prominent amongst a growing group of younger emerging artists such as George Ellias and Devendra Banhart. Dylan's early lyrics incorporated politics, social commentary, philosophy and literary influences, defying existing pop music conventions and appealing widely to the counterculture of the time. While expanding and personalizing musical styles, Dylan has shown steadfast devotion to traditions of American song, from folk and country\/blues to rock and roll and rockabilly, to Gaelic balladry, even jazz, swing and Broadway.\n\nDylan performs with the guitar, keyboard and harmonica. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s. He has also recently performed alongside other iconic artists, such as Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell, Tom Petty and Eric Clapton. Although his contributions as a performer and recording artist have been central to his career, his songwriting is generally held as his highest accomplishment.  \n\nNobel Prize for Literature (2016)  - On October 13, 2016, Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for “for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition”. The prestigious award has been given annually since 1901 and previous Nobel Laureates for Literature include Harold Pinter and Samuel Beckett. Here is the speech written by Dylan, although unable to attend:\nhttp:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/12\/10\/arts\/bob-dylan-nobel-prize-acceptance-speech.html?_r=0 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Bob+Dylan\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The band went on to play before 20,000 fans nationally with fellow Central Coasters Something with numbers. What followed goes against recent industry mantra. When only several thousand cd’s can secure number 1 in sales, The Lazys sold thousands at their gigs that year (without charting!). Hard working national tours and appearances at the Come Together festival followed, with the band building grass roots following from Brisbane to Tasmania that still support them on every much anticipated visit. Having shared the stage with the likes of US Rockers Against Me, UK’s The Answer, Hollywood’s Juliette and the Licks (Ms Lewis later seen sporting a Lazys Tee shirt!), Grinspoon, and After the Fall it was time to change gear.. \n\nThe band took their next step in June this year, getting into the studio with producer Phil McKellar (Grinspoon, Silverchair, Kisschasy, The Getaway Plan etc). The result takes the band into another dimension establishing them in Australia’s mass conscious. Singles “All Fired up”, and “Union of the Underdogs” were released in July this year and immediately caught the attention of Australian Music legend Michael Chugg who put the boys forward to Jack Daniels to go on the JD Set. After being voted on to the set in record numbers, the band set off around Australia showcasing their live set. Even when Leon the lead singer twisted his knee after jumping 20 feet off the top of the Marshall cabinets at the Gaelic club they jumped back on the tour bus and headed off to Perth (Crutches and all) for the last set of the JD Tour. And in November this year after securing in excess of 8000 votes, the band were presented live on stage in Melbourne with the Inaugural Jack Daniels Winners award by none other than Gyroscope and Jabba. \n\nQuite the year With an appearance main stage alongside \"The Living End, Kisschasy & Cog\" at the inaugural Coaster festival in September, a national tour and an EP scheduled for early 2009 the band are set to be this summer's big news.

        "biografia":"There are several artists are called Mystery.\n\n1) A project of French Canadian guitarist\/lyricist\/producer Michel St-Père, MYSTERY took form in 1986 as a six-member outfit. They released a self-titled album in 1992 that generated quite some interest across Canada. Unfortunately, a year later, their drummer Stéphane Perreault lost the use of both his legs; but his strong determination and passion for his craft inspired him with a new and unique approach to drumming: he became one of the first drummers to play from a wheelchair without the help of any pre-programmed sequences. In 1995, St-Père founded label Unicorn Records under which the band released a second album titled “Theater of the Mind” and which boasted airplay both in North America and Europe. In 1998, they released their last and most progressive album todate titled “Destiny?”, which features six guest musicians. In 2000, a compilation CD was released that marked the end of a chapter in the band’s history, as it also features their vocalist and long-time buddy Gary Savoie who has now left the band.\n\nOver the years, MYSTERY’s style has evolved from AOR (STYX, ASIA) to more adventurous art rock like that of RUSH and SAGA, but featuring delicate acoustic passages not normally heard from these two. Their music is based on St-Père’s guitar play, which is well executed yet appropriately restrained, while the keyboards remain in the background. MYSTERY won’t dazzle you with technical prowess but you will appreciate their strong melodies, outstanding vocals (Gary Savoie is often compared to JOURNEY’s Steve Perry), elegant arrangements and attention to detail. Their compilation CD “At the Dawn of a New Millenium” is made up of remastered tracks of their three albums and is a fairly good sampler of their répertoire for those wanting to get acquainted with the band.\n\nRecommended to fans of SAGA, KANSAS, JOURNEY, RUSH and to fans of melodic rock in general.\n\n2) a pagan black metal band from Hungary.

        "biografia":"Franz Ferdinand is a Scottish alternative rock  band that formed in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2002 and played an important part in the post-punk revival of the 2000s. The band consisted of Alex Kapranos (lead vocals and guitar), Bob Hardy (bass guitar), Nick McCarthy (rhythm guitar, keyboards and backing vocals) and Paul Thomson (drums, percussion and backing vocals) until 2016 when McCarthy left them. The next year  Julian Corrie (keyboards, synthesiser, guitar and backing vocals) and Dino Bardot (guitar and backing vocals) joined the band. As of October 2021, Audrey Tait (drums) has replaced Paul Thomson, after he amicably separated from the band.\n\nThe band first experienced chart success when their second single \"Take Me Out\" reached #3 in the UK Charts, followed by their debut album Franz Ferdinand, which entered the UK album chart at #3. The band went on to win the 2004 Mercury Music Prize and two BRIT Awards in 2005 for Best British Group and Best British Rock Act. NME named Franz Ferdinand as their Album of the Year. From the album, three top-ten singles were released, \"Take Me Out\", \"The Dark of the Matinée\" and \"This Fire\". The band has also received several Grammy Award nominations.\n\nThe band is named after Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria whose assassination was one of the main reasons for the start of the First World War. The band decided on the name after seeing a racehorse named Archduke Ferdinand win the Northumberland Plate in 2001, eventually coming to the decision as the alliteration and sound of the name appealed to them.\n\n- Discography\nFranz Ferdinand (2004)\nYou Could Have It So Much Better (2005)\nTonight: Franz Ferdinand (2009; and a remix album, 'Blood', released the same year)\nRight Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action (2013)\nFFS (2015); Collaborative album with the band Sparks)\nAlways Ascending (2018)\nHits to the Head  (2022)\nThe Human Fear (2025) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Franz+Ferdinand\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Breaking Benjamin is an alternative metal band Formed in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, USA in 1998 by vocalist Benjamin Burnley and drummer Jeremy Hummel, Breaking Benjamin quickly garnered a strong local following. \n\n1st Studio Album (2002) - Saturate\nThe band signed to Hollywood Records in 2001 after the success of an independently-released, self-titled EP, which sold all 2,000 copies that were manufactured. Hollywood Records released their full-length, major-label debut, Saturate, on August 27, 2002. The album's first single, \"Polyamorous\", received a fair amount of radio play, although it failed to reach mainstream audiences. A video was released in two different versions for Polyamorous: one that had all live-action footage, and one that had footage of the video game Run Like Hell. The following single \"Skin\" was also released from Saturate, although it fared worse than \"Polyamorous\" and received even less airplay. \"Skin\" was also performed live on the Jimmy Kimmel Live show. \"Medicate\" was also released as a single, to little commercial success and airplay. Saturate has gone on to sell over 300,000 copies.\n\n2nd Studio Album (2004) - We Are Not Alone\nBreaking Benjamin released their second album, We Are Not Alone, on June 29, 2004. The album featured the lead off single \"So Cold\", which reached number two on the United States Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. The band had two music videos made for the song, one of which was a promotional video made for the movie Hellboy. The commercial success of \"So Cold\" led to We Are Not Alone achieving platinum status in late 2005. Also released as singles from the album were \"Sooner or Later\" and a re- recorded version of \"Rain\", which was featured on later pressings of the album. While the former again got the band as high as number two on the Mainstream Rock chart and featured a music video, the latter garnered little radio play and had no video created for it. Another song off \"We Are Not Alone\", \"Sooner or Later\", had a video created for it and got a fair amount of radio play. Later in 2004, the band released the So Cold EP. The EP contained live recordings of We Are Not Alone's \"So Cold\" (an acoustic recording), \"Breakdown\", and \"Away\", as well as studio recordings of \"Blow Me Away\", a song that was featured in Bungie's video game Halo 2, and \"Lady Bug\", an early fan favorite of the band's.\n\nIn September of 2004, drummer, and founding member of Breaking Benjamin, Jeremy Hummel was relieved of his duties in the band. Subsequently, on September 28, 2005, Hummel filed a federal lawsuit against the remaining members of Breaking Benjamin, as well as its management, claiming he was not paid for songs he helped write. Hummel's lawsuit asked for more than $8 million in damages. A message was released October 25, 2006 on the bands official website stating that the band and Hummel had come to agreement on the lawsuit.\n\n3rd Studio Album (2006) - Phobia\nIn the fall of 2006 the band began a tour opening for Godsmack for the IV tour, hitting up mostly eastern and Ohio Valley venues, and soon moving out west, still in support of the Phobia album, released on August 8 that year. Several of the shows had been canceled, or turned into Breaking Benjamin headliners due to scheduling conflicts. Many of Breaking Benjamin's tour dates from December 3rd have been rescheduled due to illness in the band's ranks. All dates were rescheduled as the band announced another headlining leg before going on a nationwide tour with Three Days Grace and Nickelback.\n\nOn March 4, 2007, HDNet premiered a one-hour show of the Breaking Benjamin concert in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania at Stabler Arena. This is also the concert that was included on the Phobia re-release DVD in April of 2007, advertised as \"The Homecoming\". Footage of the band's live Stabler Arena performance of \"Breath\" comprises the song's music video.\n\nOn April 17, 2007, Breaking Benjamin re-released the album Phobia. The album featured a DVD with about an hour of their Stabler Arena concert footage.\n\n4th Studio Album (2009) - Dear Agony\nOn the 29th of September, 2009, Breaking Benjamin released their 4th studio album, entitled \"Dear Agony\". Some of the tracks on the album, were co-written by Jasen Rauch, from the Christian-metal band Red. \nOn September 23, 2009, Breaking Benjamin released a flash video game parody of Altered Beast, aptly titled \"Altered Benjamin\". The game contains three levels and plays the same as the original, except the player controls vocalist Ben Burnley and the three bosses are each other member of the band respectively. Altered Benjamin is still available through the band's website, and their MySpace page.\n\nCertain copies of Dear Agony purchased at Best Buy also come with a bonus DVD that includes the band's six music videos including a previously-unreleased version of the video for \"I Will Not Bow\". The version on the DVD is of the band only and does not contain any footage from the movie Surrogates, unlike the version released on the Internet.\n\nOn August 31st, 2009, prior to the release of Dear Agony, Breaking Benjamin released their first single from DA, \"I Will Not Bow\". It was featured in the 2009 Sci-Fi film [Starring Bruce Willis], \"Surrogates\". The song was not written specifically for the film, but according to drummer Chad Szeliga, “Ben sent a few songs to our record label, Hollywood Records,” which is owned by Disney, who then decided they “wanted a Breaking Benjamin song for this movie.”\n\nThe music video for I Will Not Bow was released to the band's Myspace on August 21, 2009. The video was shot at the World Trade Center building 7, but has no connection or significant meaning having to do with the 9\/11 events as stated by Aaron Fink in his Point interview on August 13, 2009. The video was directed by Rich Lee who has also directed for Evanescence. Lee chose the location, feeling it was an eerie place to film.\nA second version of the music video without the Surrogates footage was released with the Best Buy Exclusive version of Dear Agony. It includes various bridged footage of the band performing.\n\nOn January 5, 2010, Give Me a Sign was the second single released from Breaking Benjamin's fourth studio album, Dear Agony.\n\n2 extra tracks were featured on the Japanese version of \"Dear Agony\". An acoustic version of 'Without You', and an acoustic version 'Give Me A Sign'.\n\nHiatus, greatest hits album and legal issues (2010-2014)\nIn the summer of 2010, Breaking Benjamin announced an indefinite hiatus, due to Burnley's recurring illnesses. Guitarist Fink and bassist Klepaski rejoined their old band, Lifer, and Szeliga toured with his other band, OurAfter.\n\nOn June 7, 2011, a remixed version of \"Blow Me Away\", featuring Valora, was released.[17] An animated music video for the remix was released on August 24.[18] On June 30, 2011, Rock Access posted the tracklist for the band's greatest hits album, Shallow Bay: The Best of Breaking Benjamin, and for its \"deluxe edition\".[19] It was released on August 16, as a one-disc \"standard edition\" and a two-disc \"deluxe edition\" (featuring b-sides and rarities). Burnley publicly opposed the album's release, saying content had been altered and released without his consent, and that it did not meet his standards.\n\nIn May 2011, Burnley fired bandmates Fink and Klepaski. Shortly after, a dispute over the new version of \"Blow Me Away\" went public. Burnley gave his side of the dispute in a June court filing, saying Fink and Klepaski made unilateral and unauthorized decisions on behalf of the band, such as giving permission in May for the remixing of \"Blow Me Away\". Burnley seeks at least $250,000 and the exclusive right to the \"Breaking Benjamin\" name. Burnley has stated he plans to revive the band when the lawsuit is settled.\n\nLittle was heard from the band throughout 2012, the only exception being a February 2012 interview with Szeliga, where he assured fans that the band was still together, and that he looked forward to working on another record in the future. On April 19, 2013, Burnley announced that the legal issues had finally ended, with Burnley winning the rights to the name of the band. However, Szeliga posted an announcement on his Facebook page on April 22 that he was leaving the band, due to creative differences. In October-November 2013, Burnley played a number of acoustic performances around the Wilkes-Barre area, playing Breaking Benjamin songs.\n\nReformation (2014)\nOn August 19, 2014, the band announced that they had reformed via their official Facebook page. The band re-emerged as a quintet, consisting Burnley as the lead vocalist and four new members. New members include guitarist Jasen Rauch, previously of the band Red, who had previously collaborated with the band off of four tracks on Dear Agony, guitarist Keith Wallen, previously of Adelitas Way, bassist Aaron Bruch, who played a couple of acoustic shows previously with Burnley, and drummer Shaun Foist, previously of the band Picture Me Broken.\n\n5th Studio Album (2015) - Dark Before Dawn\nBurnley explained that writing for Dark Before Dawn was intermittent and fragmentary, taking place throughout the hiatus, though it was toward the end of the hiatus in 2013 when it became cohesive. After growing frustrated with the lack of answers regarding his health condition, Burnley decided to abandon searching for a diagnosis and focus on the album. Recorded and produced at a personal studio of Burnley's, Dark Before Dawn is the first album with the front man credited as the producer. The singer stated that \"I would say that I did the same amount of producing on this album as I've done on other albums, just never had my name [on it]\", adding, \"You know, I'm not doing anything different here than I have done in the past. Why shouldn't I be known to be doing it?\"\n\nWithin an hour of pre-order availability, Dark Before Dawn reached No. 1 on the rock albums chart on iTunes and No. 3 on the overall album chart. It sold 135,000 pure album units and 141,000 equivalent album units in its first week, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, making the album the group's heretofore most successful sales effort.\n\nIn July 2015, the band announced their first overseas performance, in which they headlined a four-day cruise venue in February 2016 along with Yngwie Malmsteen, Zakk Wylde, Flyleaf, et al. The band also performed on a joint U.S. tour with Shinedown in October and November along with Sevendust, and proceeded to play further outside of the United States in June 2016 at venues such as the Download Festival in the United Kingdom, Rock am Ring in Germany, and Nova Rock in Austria.\n\n6th Studio Album (2018-present) - Ember\nThe group's sixth studio album was first revealed to be completed in August 2017. In December 2017, Ember and its lead single \"Red Cold River\" were announced for release in the second quarter of 2018 and January 5, 2018, respectively. On January 26, \"Feed the Wolf\" was released as a pre-order bonus, along with a release date for the album of April 13, 2018. Three subsequent songs—\"Blood\", \"Psycho\", and \"Save Yourself\"—were released ahead of the album as promotional releases.\n\nWriting for the album began in 2016, with recording primarily happening in 2017. While Burnley remained the primary composer for the album, he stated that around half of it was written by the rest of the band. Burnley returned to producing for the album, along with the rest of the band, a first for the group. Rauch commented that the album pushes the boundaries with heavier material than the band's done in the past. He said \"playing-wise, it's the most difficult album\", and that they took advantage of the three-guitar player dynamic, but that the album nonetheless does not depart from Breaking Benjamin's established sound. Burnley explained that there was demand for heavier material from fans, and that the group was happy to reflect that. He later explained that he believed fans gravitated to the heavier side of the band, but that \"we also make sure to explore our melodic and softer side too\", saying that the album seeks to give both sides to the furthest degree. Burnley stated that he chose Ember as the album title as something that could be the end of something or the start of it, but emphasized an intentional ambiguity to leave it open to interpretation.\n\nIt sold 88,000 units in its first week of sales, debuting at No. 3 on the Billboard 200. \"Red Cold River\" peaked at No. 2 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart,[90] and No. 5 on the Hot Rock Songs chart.\n\nSingles Chronology\n2002 - Polyamorous\n2003 - Skin\n2003 - Medicate\n2004 - So Cold [EP]*\n2004 - Sooner or Later\n2005 - Rain (Drums re-recorded by Chad Szeliga)\n2006 - The Diary Of Jane\n2006 - Breath\n2006 - Until The End\n2009 - I Will Not Bow\n2010 - Give Me A Sign\n2015 - Failure\n2015 - Angels Fall\n2016 - Never Again\n2018 - Red Cold River\n2018 - Torn In Two\n2018 - Tourniquet\n\n\n*So Cold [EP] featured 5 songs, 'So Cold (Acoustic)', 'Blow Me Away', 'Lady Bug', 'Away (Live)' and 'Breakdown (Live)'.\n\nName Origin\nThe name \"Breaking Benjamin\" comes from Benjamin Burnley's early solo experience. Burnley was covering a Nirvana song during an open-mic night at a club when he finished he dropped the microphone to the ground, breaking it. The person who owned the microphone came on stage and said, 'Thanks to Benjamin for breaking my fucking mic.' In 1999, the band briefly renamed themselves \"Plan 9.\" In late 2000, after various line-up changes, the band changed its name back to \"Breaking Benjamin\" and two friends of Burnley, Aaron Fink and Mark Klepaski, left their previous band, Lifer, and joined the ranks of Breaking Benjamin as guitarist and bassist, respectively. Lifer was a band that gained brief mainstream attention because of their part in an MTV cover band contest that resulted in a record deal with Universal Records.\n\nTheir official site - www.breakingbenjamin.com <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Breaking+Benjamin\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Jarabe de Palo (literally \"Wooden Stick Syrup\" or, after the Spanish expression \"dar un jarabe de palo\", i.e. a \"hell of a beating\"), was a Spanish rock band founded in 1996. The group was led by singer, songwriter, and guitarist Pau Donés, whose death in 2020 caused the band to break up.\n\nPau Donés, born and raised in Barcelona, worked for various groups before being able to take on his current project, Jarabe de Palo. He began at age 15 with his brother Marc, with whom he formed a group known as J.& Co.Band and later another one named Dentaduras Postizas. During this period, he completed his musical tracks in Barcelona with a job at an advertising firm.\n\nHis greatest success came to him after a trip to Cuba, where he was inspired to write La Flaca which became the title of his first album, \"La Flaca,\" in 1996. A year later came the big surprise: millions of albums were sold around the world, and \"La Flaca\" became the song of the summer in 1997.\n\nAfter this great success on his first album, Pau was determined to show that the band would not be a one-hit wonder, and with this idea, he launched Depende (1998), which was produced by Joe Dworniak in Moody Studios in London over two months. This album featured collaborations with the likes of Ketama and continued with Jarabe de Palo's ironic and ingenious lyrics, which managed to connect with the Hispanic public and even made inroads among Italians.\n\nIn 2001 they released De vuelta y vuelta, their most conceptual album. It showed a change in the band with the first music video of the album, in which Pau appears shaving his head, shedding his long-haired features. This album featured collaborations with the likes of Antonio Vega, Jovanotti, Vico C, and Celia Cruz.\n\nIn 2003 the band tried to show a change to more positive songs with their album Bonito, which featured the likes of Los Mártires del Compás, the singer-songwriter Elena Andujar, and their Italian friend, Jovanotti.\n\nIn the autumn of 2004, the band announced that they would go on tour with their new album, 1 m2 (Un metro cuadrado (A Square Meter)) featuring the likes of Jorge Drexler, Lucrecia, and Chrissie Hynde (The Pretenders).\n\nThe group has received great awards such as Premios de la Música, Premio Ondas, and Grammy nominations. They have collaborated with La Vieja Trova Santiaguera, Antonio Vega, Vico C and Celia Cruz (soundtrack of El milagro de P. Tinto). Pau has also composed tracks for Ricky Martin and starred in a music video with Alanis Morissette.\n\nOn 9 June 2020, Donés died near Barcelona after five years of dealing with colon cancer, causing the band to split up shortly after. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Jarabe+de+Palo\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"There is more than one artist known as Graveyard:\n\n1. Graveyard is a hard rock band from Gothenburg, Sweden. \n\nJoakim Nilsson, Rikard Edlund (both formerly of Norrsken), Axel Sjöberg, and Truls Mörck formed Graveyard in 2006. When Norrsken disbanded in 2000, guitarist Magnus Pelander went on to form doomy folk metal act Witchcraft and Nilsson and Edlund joined Albatros, a growly blues rock band whose lineup also included Sjöberg on drums. Initially they considered Albatros a hobby project, but after five years the members began taking their music more seriously and had grown dissatisfied with the direction their sound had taken. When Albatros broke up, Nilsson and Edlund decided that for their next venture, they would head back towards their roots as musicians and songwriters. Nilsson explains, “I am a singer, but in Albatross I only played guitar. Rikard played guitar but he is a bass player. We also wanted a more straightforward [rock] sound.”\n\nTogether with Sjöberg and guitarist\/singer Truls Mörck they began practicing as Graveyard. Upon their initial formation, Graveyard quickly recorded a two track demo, played a total of three shows, and began planning for a full-length album with Swedish boutique label, Transubstans Records. In the meantime, they posted a demo of some of their material on MySpace. Songs from the band's Myspace caught the ear of Tony Presedo, founder of TeePee Records. Their self-titled debut album was recorded by Don Ahlsterberg and released in early 2008. On the recording sessions' completion, Truls Mörck was replaced by guitarist Jonatan Ramm. The debut album received generally good reviews. Graveyard performed at the 2008's South by Southwest Music Festival.\n\nGraveyard was featured on Rolling Stone Magazine's Fricke's Picks for their first ever US gig at SXSW.[4] After SXSW, Graveyard toured with label mates Witch. In the Fall of 2008 Graveyard toured with Witchcraft and then Clutch. In 2009 they toured with the rock band CKY. Graveyard released their second album in spring of 2011.\n\n2. Graveyard is also a melodic stoner rock\/metal band from Vilnius, Lithuania. The band was formed in 2005 by five young like-minded guys. Later, the rhythm guitarist Artas left the band. Graveyard made a break when due to disagreements their vocalist Donatas Gailiušis also left the band. In the late spring of 2008 the band got back with a new vocalist and are ready to rock the stage again. The current members are: Simonas Palevičius (vocals), Marius Palivonas (guitar), Vaidotas Segenis (drums) and Martynas Samulevičius (bass guitar). \n\n3. Furthermore, Graveyard is an Old School Death Metal band formed in 2007 near Barcelona, Spain, based on the roots of classic Death Metal Bands like Grave, Death or Dismember. In 2007 they released their first Demo CD \"Into the Mausoleum\". During 2009 they also released two split records together with Terrorist and Deathevokation. In September 1st 2010 they realeased their first full lengtht album called \"One with the Dead\". Official website: www.graveyardofdoom.com\/\n\n4. A Japanese power electronics project which released several cassettes starting in 1985.  They played a style similar to early Whitehouse.\n\n5. Serbian Heavy, Thrash Metal band from Kruševac.The band was formed in February of 2009. Graveyard won a rock&roll marathon in Kruševac, where they had beaten their competition of almost 20 bands, and the reward helped them as a part of the recording budget. They recorded 5 songs for their EP \"The Black Knight\". In June of 2010, they won the \"Sumadijski Demo Fest\" in Kragujevac, Their song \"Glory\" was released on a compilation album for Serbian metal magazine \"Nocturne\", and in August they took second place in \"Battle Of the Bands\" competition in Lazarevac.

        "biografia":"The Goo Goo Dolls are an alternative rock band that formed in 1986 in Buffalo, New York. They are perhaps most famous for the hit \"Iris,\" featured on the soundtrack to the 1998 film City of Angels. Currently, the band consists of three members:\n\n    * Johnny Rzeznik - Vocals, guitar (Founding member)\n    * Robby Takac - Vocals, bass (Founding member)\n    * Mike Malinin - Drums (Hired in 1995, made official member in 1998)\n\nFounded in Buffalo, New York, the Goo Goo Dolls, who were then known as the \"Sex Maggots,\" initially consisted of John Rzeznik, Robby Takac, and George Tutuska. The band changed their name to the Goo Goo Dolls (the name was picked out from an ad in a True Detective magazine) at the request of a local club owner who refused to let them play otherwise. They were originally signed on by Metal Blade Records, and they released their self-titled debut album in 1987.\n\nIn their early career, they were often dismissed by critics as \" The Replacements wannabes.\" While they were embraced by college radio and the local punk scene (Playing such venues as CBGB's), especially after the release of their third album, Hold Me Up (1990), it was not until 1995, with the release of their single \"Name,\" (from the album A Boy Named Goo) that the Goo Goo Dolls experienced any commercial success. Their mainstream success, however, was bittersweet as they faced a lengthy legal battle with Metal Blade Records over royalties that were being withheld from the band; hence, the Goos eventually switched to Metal Blade's parent company, Warner Brothers. In 1998, \"Iris\" was released on the City of Angels soundtrack, and the Goos were propelled to stardom, as the song stayed on the Billboard charts at number one for 18 weeks and was nominated for three Grammys that year. The song was also included on their fifth album, \"Dizzy Up the Girl,\" which was released that same year.\n\nAs of February 2007, The Goo Goo Dolls broke the record of having the most top 10 songs on the AC Charts, with 12 top 10 hits! Beating out Matchbox 20 and Sheryl Crow with only 10 hits. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/+noredirect\/The+Goo+Goo+Dolls\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"\"Normandie\" may refer to more than one band:\n\n1. An alternative rock band from Örebro, Sweden, known for their seamless fusion of post-hardcore energy, cinematic electronics, and emotionally charged melodies. Formed in late 2013, the band began as a six-piece outfit with Philip Strand and Johan Lindström sharing vocal duties, joined by guitarists Joel Felix and Håkan Almbladh, bassist Stefan Timmerholm, and drummer Jesper Malmberg. Initially rooted in metalcore and post-hardcore, their early sound was heavier and more aggressive, evident with their debut self-titled EP. They've also covered one of Sia's top hits: Chandelier.\n\nAs the band progressed, their sound evolved toward a more melodic, polished, and genre-blending style. The departure of Lindström in 2015 led Strand to take over as the sole frontman, steering Normandie toward a more dynamic and emotionally driven direction. This shift culminated in their debut full-length album Inguz (2016), which marked a major stylistic breakthrough. Tracks like \"Collide\" and \"Awakening\" showcased their ability to blend anthemic choruses with ambient textures and raw vulnerability.\n\nTheir 2018 follow-up, White Flag, pushed their boundaries further, combining arena-ready rock hooks with thoughtful lyricism that touched on themes of resistance, identity, and defiance. The album solidified their reputation as a standout act within the modern alt-rock scene and brought them to larger international stages, touring across Europe and the UK. Despite lineup changes — eventually narrowing to the trio of Strand, Almbladh, and new drummer Anton Franzon — the band retained its sonic richness, largely due to Strand’s work as both frontman and producer. During this time, the band covered All the Time (originally sung by Zara Larsson), and Believe (originally sung Cher).\n\nIn 2021, the band released Dark & Beautiful Secrets, a deeply personal and concept-driven album exploring childhood trauma, mental health, and spiritual conflict. The album was praised for its honesty, cohesion, and cinematic scope. “We need to be accepting of other people’s secrets, and willing to share our own.”\n\nBuilding on that momentum, their 2024 record Dopamine embraced a bold new format: each track was released monthly in a year-long campaign called the “Dopamine Clinic,” reflecting on the overstimulation and emotional desensitization brought by modern digital life. The album marked yet another creative peak, with songs like “Serotonin” and “Hourglass” (featuring Dani Winter-Bates, the lead vocalist of Bury Tomorrow), capturing both vulnerability and intensity in equal measure. And, in October 9, 2024, Normandie and the Australian band Hands Like Houses collaborated on \"Hurts Like Hell\", a track reminiscent of \"Babylon\".\n\nOn November 7, 2025, they released a new track called \"Sellout\". It is the first song they've released without a label (previously Easy Life Records).\n\nOn December 12, 2025, they announced their upcoming EP named \"SIDE EFFECTS PT. 1\", coming out on April 17, 2026.\n\n2.

        "biografia":"Lindsey Adams Buckingham (born October 3, 1949) is an American guitarist, singer, composer and producer, most notable for being the guitarist and male lead singer of Fleetwood Mac. As a member of Fleetwood Mac, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2011, Buckingham was ranked 100th in Rolling Stone magazine's, 2011 list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". The magazine described him as \"one of the most under-valued visionaries in rock\".\n\nBuckingham was arguably the principal creative force behind the 70s version of Fleetwood Mac. He is not only one of the main singer\/songwriters, but also producer, leading them on an unusual journey from the commercial heights of 1977's Rumours (still among the biggest-selling albums ever) to the quirkily experimental double album Tusk in 1979.\n\nBuckingham is also recognized as a unique & influential guitarist. Unlike many rock guitarists, Buckingham does not use a plectrum\/pick, instead, he uses his fingers and fingernails. \n\nBuckingham has recorded 6 studio albums and two live albums with Fleetwood Mac, and 6 studio albums and three live albums as a solo artist. The In Our Own Time Songfacts reports that Buckingham's sixth solo album, Seeds We Sow, was recorded at his LA home and he played most of the instruments himself. The record came out on September 6, 2011 and was his first to be self-released. As a member of Fleetwood Mac, he was inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nInitially after joining Fleetwood Mac, Buckingham used a Gibson Les Paul guitar. Before the band, a Fender Telecaster was his main guitar, and was used on his first Fleetwood Mac album. In 1979, he worked with Rick Turner, owner of Renaissance Guitars to create the Model One. He has used it extensively since, both with Fleetwood Mac and for his solo efforts. He uses a Taylor Guitar 814ce for most of his acoustic performances and has also used an Ovation Celebrity in the past.\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lindsey+Buckingham\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The Valar developed 2 EPs and 1 Album throughout its 3-year lifespan. That being \"Valague​ñ​a\", \"The Project\", and \"The Adventures of a Septapus Named Wallace\". The group disbanded in 2010 due to each member matriculating at different colleges, deeming it impractical to continue making music for the majority of the year. McLaughlin and Imbusch left the band, met Stone and Cohen at their respective colleges, and decided to add them to the band. Thus forming The Rare Occasions. McLaughlin came up with the name after the band went through an \"identity crisis,\" eventually settling on \"The Rare Occasions\" instead of \"The Custodians,\" which they previously went by.\n\nShortly after the release of their first album Into The Shallows, lead guitarist Peter Stone left the band amicably, leading to the band becoming a 3-piece.\n\nBand later relocated from Boston, Massachusetts to Los Angeles, California, where they recorded their second album.\n\nTheir first release was the Demo Recordings EP, released on October 12, 2012, followed by Applefork in 2013.

Their management company is FYD. The label is Sony Music Records. The abbreviation is マンウィズ (“Man With”). The band consists of five ultimate beings with wolf heads and human bodies. Because of their appearance, they are also colloquially referred to as the オオカミバンド (ookami band, \"wolf band\"). They were signed to FROM YOUTH TO DEATH RECORDS from 2010 on. From 2011 to 2013 they've also been signed to CROWN STONES. Since 2013 they are signed to Sony Records.\n\nAccording to the official story, they were created in the 19XXs, an era when the Earth was repeatedly ravaged by war, in a place called Electric Lady Land, located at the ends of the Earth. They were born as a result of the mad science of a genius biologist named Jimmy Hendrix. Because Jimmy himself enjoyed playing guitar, musical ability was programmed into them. With their superhuman physical and mental capabilities, they were used by powerful figures such as Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, and even Gihren Zabi. Tormented by guilt, Jimmy froze them in Antarctic glaciers at the cost of his own life to keep them from being used by anyone.\n\nWhile frozen, they listened to music from around the world with their highly developed wolf hearing, but after hearing the sounds of AIR JAM 1997, they decided to start musical activities to change the world through music. Although they remained frozen for some time, global warming caused the ice to melt in 2010, leading to their revival and the start of their band activities.\n\nThe exact time of the band’s formation has not been disclosed. The members’ ages and nationalities are also not publicly known. In terms of songwriting, guitarist Jean-Ken Johnny and bassist Kamikaze Boy mainly handle the lyrics. For composition, Jean-Ken Johnny and Kamikaze Boy decide on the basic chord progressions, rhythm patterns, and general image, after which all members discuss and finalize the detailed arrangements. Most of their songs are structured with Jean-Ken Johnny singing the verses and Tokyo Tanaka singing the choruses.\n\nAt their live shows, the intro SE used for their appearance is Bad Religion’s “Man With A Mission,” a song that shares the same name as the band. The album “Recipe For Hate,” which includes this song, features two people with wolf heads on the cover, just like MWAM members.\n\nAmong the members, only Jean-Ken Johnny is officially able to speak Japanese, but Tokyo Tanaka sings vocals, Kamikaze Boy provides backing vocals and writes lyrics in both Japanese and English, and Spear Rib has answered interviews in Japanese, suggesting that while they cannot pronounce it, they understand it. In the liner notes for “database feat. TAKUMA (10-FEET),” it is revealed that Kamikaze Boy can also speak. Their written language officially uses only katakana, avoiding hiragana except for some specific cases such as proper nouns. When text length becomes excessive, hiragana is occasionally used in what is described as “translation.” Since August 2012, the magazine Monthly GiGS has used a “Man With converter” to translate their text into Japanese, though it frequently malfunctions, reverting the text back to katakana. In the documentary film MAN WITH A MISSION THE MOVIE -TRACE the HISTORY-, an automatic translator called “Gauringal” appears, allowing members other than Jean-Ken Johnny to speak.\n\nDuring live performances, Tokyo Tanaka, Jean-Ken Johnny, and Kamikaze Boy have jaws that open widely. In live footage, the lower jaws are often not shown. When performing on television, usually only Tokyo Tanaka and Jean-Ken Johnny’s jaws move.\n\nTokyo Tanaka – Main vocals, leader.

        "biografia":"Bring Me the Horizon is a British metalcore\/pop rock\/electronic band formed in Sheffield, England, in 2004. The group currently consists of lead vocalist Oli Sykes, drummer Matt Nicholls, guitarist Lee Malia, and bassist Matt Kean. They are signed to RCA Records globally and to Columbia Records in the United States.\n\nThe band released its debut album \"Count Your Blessings\" in 2006. The album featured a deathcore style that received mixed reactions and generally unfavorable reviews from critics. In 2008, the band released its second album, \"Suicide Season,\" marking a shift in musical direction. This release is often viewed as a significant point in the band's development, receiving more positive critical and commercial attention.\n\nTheir third album, \"There Is a Hell Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven Let's Keep It a Secret.\" was released in 2010 and expanded the band's sound by incorporating elements of classical music, electronica, and pop. The band's major label debut, \"Sempiternal,\" released in 2013, achieved commercial success, earning Gold certification in Australia and Silver in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2015, \"That's the Spirit\" debuted at number two on both the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200. Their sixth studio album, \"Amo,\" released in 2019, became their first album to reach number one in the UK. That same year, they released \"Music to Listen To...\" followed by \"Post Human: Survival Horror\" in 2020. \"Post Human: Nex Gen,\" the second release in the planned \"Post Human\" series, was issued as their seventh studio album in May 2024.\n\nThe band has also released two extended plays and two live albums. They have received multiple accolades, including seven Kerrang! Awards, a BRIT Award for Best Rock\/Alternative Act, and two Grammy Award nominations. Bring Me the Horizon has sold over 5 million records worldwide and has reached the top of the UK Rock & Metal Singles Chart with songs such as \"Throne,\" \"Drown,\" \"Mantra,\" \"Parasite Eve,\" \"Teardrops,\" and \"Kool-Aid.\"\n\nTheir early musical style, exemplified by \"Count Your Blessings,\" is often categorized as deathcore. Over time, however, the band's sound has drastically changed. An initial shift towards metalcore was later replaced by elements of electronica, pop, alternative rock, and hip-hop. Eventually, all vestigial traces of metal were dropped from their music, other than screamed vocals—which are performed in a style more reminiscent of screamo or emo than any type of metal. These changes greatly boosted the band's popularity, but caused them to become a subject of ridicule and anathema to the metal community.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bring_Me_the_Horizon\n\nStudio albums\nCount Your Blessings (2006)\nSuicide Season (2008)\nThere Is a Hell Believe Me I've Seen It.

        "biografia":"Sextile is an American post-punk band from Los Angeles, California. The band consists of founding members Brady Keehn (vocals, guitar, electronics) and Melissa Scaduto (drums, electronics, guitar). The band takes its name from the aspect of the same name in astrology.\n\nHistory\nSextile was formed in 2015 by Keehn and Scaduto, after the duo relocated from Brooklyn, New York to Los Angeles. They were soon joined by bassist Kenny Elkin and multi-instrumentalist Eddie Wuebben. Signing to Felte Records after supporting Ritual Howls at local gigs, the band released its debut album, A Thousand Hands in the same year. Its follow-up, Albeit Living, was released in 2017; by the time of its release, Elkin was replaced by bassist Cameron Michel.\n\nIn 2018, Sextile released the single \"Current Affair,\" with the band reduced to its two founding members for their EP, 3, later in the year. Sextile entered a hiatus in 2019, with Keehn and Scaduto pursuing other projects, Panther Modern and S. Product, respectively. The band's former guitarist, Eddie Wuebben, died on 5 October 2019, at the age of 29.\n\nSextile broke its hiatus with the March 2022 release of \"Modern Weekend\"\/\"Contortion\", both having been written after Wuebben's death. For summer 2022 tour dates in Mexico and the U.S., Cameron Michel rejoined the band on guitar and keyboards along with new drummer Lia Simone Braswell, formerly of Le Butcherettes and A Place to Bury Strangers. On September 15, 2023, the band has released their third album, Push, on Sacred Bones Records, which was accompanied by a North American tour. Following the departure of Michel, the band announced their fourth studio album, yes, please., which was released on May 2, 2025 on Sacred Bones Records.\n\nMusical style\nSextile's sound has been described as post-punk and electronic rock. Their debut album featured an \"occult-inspired post-punk style\" that blended industrial, surf punk, psychobilly and ambient music; the band drew influences from Christian Death, Coil, Brian Eno, The Cramps and The Haxan Cloak during this period. AllMusic critic Heather Phares thought that the record \"gave deathrock some new life\" while featuring \"descending riffs, martial beats, and outbursts that light up the darkness like flares.\" Their second album, Albeit Living, marked a change in style with a synth-punk sound that was likened to the works of Circle X, Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft and Chrome. Michael Toland of The Austin Chronicle wrote that the record collects \"post-punk's angular chords, synth-pop's buzzing colors, No Wave's brash indifference, and goth's pessimistic glower.\" Its follow-up, 2018's 3 EP, showcased further embracement of electronics while introducing elements from EBM and dark wave. The band's third studio album, Push, has showcased significant influences from electronic dance music. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Sextile\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"The Smashing Pumpkins is an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois. The band was formed in 1988 by Billy Corgan and James Iha, with bassist D'arcy Wretzky  and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin joining shortly after. Despite going through many lineup changes, the current lineup is identical to the original, with the exception of Wretzky, who would end up leaving the band just before their initial breakup in 2000.\n\nDisavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegaze, grunge, and, in later recordings, electronica. Corgan is the group's primary songwriter; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\".\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. 1998's Adore would just barely miss out, peaking at number two. With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up.\n\nIn 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles, compilation EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014. Chamberlin and Iha officially rejoined the band in February 2018. The reunited lineup has released four albums so far—Shiny and Oh So Bright, Vol. 1 \/ LP: No Past. No Future. No Sun. in November 2018, Cyr in November 2020, ATUM in 2023, and Aghori Mhori Mei in August 2023. The last has been well received for its move away from the synth-heavy Cyr and ATUM, returning to the heavy guitars and drums of the band's 90s origins. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Smashing+Pumpkins\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Supertramp is a British group playing a mix of progressive rock and pop rock that notably had a series of top-selling albums in the 70s, producing several hit singles. The band was formed in the United Kingdom in 1969. All the group's members were musicians capable of playing multiple types of instruments, including brass and woodwinds. Co-founder, composer and lead singer, Roger Hodgson left the band in 1983 to bring up his children. In 1988, Supertramp re-formed with some former members plus several new ones, and they continue to tour. \n\nMusic in their early period consisted of ambitious concept albums, but they are best known for their pop-influenced tracks such as \"Dreamer\", \"Give a Little Bit\",\" Goodbye Stranger\", and \"The Logical Song\", among others. Going for an arena-friendly sound in the 70s and 80s, they achieved the same sort of vibe as contemporaries Asia, Boston, Styx, and so on. The band's name was taken from W.H. Davies' 1908 novel The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp.\n\nTheir 'golden era' albums 'Crime of the Century' (1974) and 'Even in the Quietest Moments' (1977) were both notably produced by former Beatles producer Ken Scott. Their 1979 album 'Breakfast in America' also reached number one on the Billboard album charts (number three in the U.K. as well) and was certified platinum four times by the RIAA.\n\nA more thorough Bio:\nSupertramp are an English rock band formed in 1969 under the name Daddy before renaming themselves in early 1970. Though their music was initially categorised as progressive rock, they have since incorporated a combination of traditional rock, pop and art rock into their music. The band's work is marked by the songwriting of Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson, the voice of Hodgson, and the use of Wurlitzer electric piano and saxophone in their songs.\nWhile the band's early work was mainstream progressive rock, they would enjoy greater critical and commercial success when they incorporated more conventional and radio-friendly elements into their work in the mid-1970s, going on to sell more than 60 million albums. They reached their peak of commercial success with 1979's Breakfast in America, which has sold more than 20 million copies.\nThough their albums were generally far more successful than their singles. Supertramp did enjoy a number of major hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including \"Bloody Well Right\", \"Give a Little Bit\", \"The Logical Song\", \"Goodbye Stranger\", \"Take the Long Way Home\", \"Dreamer\", \"Breakfast in America\", \"It's Raining Again\", and \"Cannonball\". The band attained significant popularity in the United States, Canada, Europe, South Africa and Australia. Since Hodgson's departure in 1983, founder Rick Davies has led the band by himself.\n\n1969–72: Early years\nIn 1969 Stanley 'Sam' August Miesegaes, a Dutch millionaire, became disappointed with, then dropped, The Joint, the band he was financially supporting. He offered Swindon-born keyboardist Rick Davies, whose talent he felt had been \"bogged down\" by the group,an opportunity to form his own band, again with Miesegaes's financial backing. Davies assembled Roger Hodgson (bass and vocals), Richard Palmer (guitars), and Keith Baker (percussion) after placing an advertisement in the weekly music newspaper, Melody Maker.\nDavies and Hodgson had radically different backgrounds and musical inspirations: Davies was working class and fiercely devoted to blues and jazz, while Hodgson had gone straight from private school to the music business and was fond of pop and psychedelia. Despite this, they hit it off during the auditions and began writing virtually all of their songs together, with Palmer as a third writer in the mix. Since none of the other band members was willing, Palmer penned all their lyrics.\nThe group initially dubbed themselves Daddy. Baker was almost immediately replaced by former stage actor Robert Millar, and after several months of rehearsal at a country house in West Hythe, Kent, the band flew to Munich for a series of concerts at the P. N. Club.One 10 minute performance there of \"All Along The Watchtower\" was filmed by Haro Senft (Supertramp Portrait 1970).The rehearsals had been less than productive, and their initial repertoire consisted of only four songs, two of which were covers.[15] To avoid confusion with the similarly named Daddy Longlegs,the band changed its name to \"Supertramp\", a moniker inspired by The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp by William Henry Davies.\n\nSupertramp Mark II. L-R: \nRoger Hodgson, Frank Farrell, Rick Davies, Kevin Currie, and Dave Winthrop.\nSupertramp were one of the first groups to be signed to the UK branch of A&M Records and their first album, Supertramp, was released on 14 July 1970 in the UK and Canada (it would not be issued in the US until late 1977). Stylistically, the album was fairly typical of progressive rock of the era and Supertramp's sound bore obvious similarity to their British progressive rock predecessor Cressida.Despite receiving a good deal of critical praise, the album did not attract a large audience.\nDave Winthrop (flute and saxophone) joined the group after the release of the first record and soon after Supertramp performed at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival. The membership continued to change in the six months following the album's release; Palmer left the band due to personality conflicts with Davies and Hodgson, followed by Millar, who had suffered a nervous breakdown following a disastrous tour of Norway.\nFor the next album, Indelibly Stamped, released in June 1971 in both the UK and US, Frank Farrell (bass) and Kevin Currie (percussion) replaced Palmer and Millar, while Hodgson switched to guitar and Davies served as a second lead singer. With Palmer's departure, Hodgson and Davies wrote the lyrics for this and the band's subsequent albums. The record sold even less than their debut.[9] In the aftermath, all members gradually quit except Hodgson and Davies,[18] and Miesegaes withdrew his financial support in October 1972.\n1973–78: Initial success and commercial breakthrough[edit]\nA search for new members brought aboard Dougie Thomson (bass), who had done stand-in gigs with the band for almost a year before auditions resumed. In 1973, auditions restarted and introduced Bob Siebenberg (initially credited as Bob C. Benberg; drums & percussion) and John Helliwell (saxophone, other woodwinds, occasional keyboards, backing vocals), completing the line-up. Hodgson would also begin playing keyboards (particularly the Wurlitzer electric piano) in the band in addition to guitar.[18] This lineup of Supertramp would remain in place for the next ten years.\nMeanwhile, the bond between Davies and Hodgson had begun weakening. In July 1972 Hodgson had tried LSD for the first time, and offered some to Davies, who declined. Writing to Miesegaes in November 1972, Hodgson described taking LSD as \"the happiest day of my life\" and expressed his anxiety that Davies would not take it. He would later describe this divergence in their experiences as the root of the rift between them. Over Supertramp's history, their relationship would be amicable but increasingly distant as their lifestyles and musical inclinations saw less and less overlap. Their songwriting partnership gradually dissolved; though all of Supertramp's songs would continue to be officially credited as \"written by Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson\", most of them were written by Davies or Hodgson individually.\nSupertramp needed a hit record to continue working, and finally got one with Crime of the Century. Released in September 1974, it began the group's run of critical and commercial successes, hitting number 4 in Britain, number 38 in the USA, and number 1 in Canada. The album underlined its ambitiousness: Many of its songs were heavily orchestrated, and some even featured Davies and Hodgson singing in dialogue, such as the 1975 UK Top 20 single \"Dreamer\". US listeners preferred its B-side, \"Bloody Well Right\", which hit the US Top 40 in May 1975 and would be their only hit in the country for more than two years. Most of the band have said they feel they hit their artistic peak on this album,[citation needed] though their greatest commercial success would come later.\nWith a hit album under their belt, pressures on the band increased, and the followup Crisis? What Crisis? had to be recorded in the few months between two scheduled concert tours. As a consequence, most of the material consisted of leftover songs from Crime of the Century, and decades later the band would continue to regard the album as one of their worst moments.Despite Supertramp's own misgivings, the album was well received by critics, and when released in November 1975, it broke both the UK Top Twenty and the USA Top Fifty in spite of its singles all being commercial flops.\nThe following album, Even in the Quietest Moments..., released in April 1977, spawned a hit single with \"Give a Little Bit\" (no. 15 US, no. 29 UK). As usual, the popularity of the album itself eclipsed that of its singles, and Even in the Quietest Moments... hit no. 16 in the USA and no. 12 in the UK. During this period, the band eventually relocated to the United States.\n\n1979–88: Superstardom\nThe band's switch to a more pop-oriented approach peaked with their most popular album, Breakfast in America, released in March 1979, which reached number 3 in the UK and number 1 in the United States and Canada and spawned four successful singles (more than their first five albums combined): \"The Logical Song\" (no. 6 U.S., no. 7 U.K.), \"Goodbye Stranger\" (no. 15 U.S., no. 57 U.K.), \"Take the Long Way Home\" (no. 10 U.S.), and \"Breakfast in America\" (no. 9 U.K.). In March 1979, the group embarked on a 10 month 120 date tour for Breakfast In America that required 52 tons of gear, 10 miles of cable, $5 million worth of equipment and a 40 man crew.[citation needed] The tour broke all previous concert attendance records in Europe and Canada. Upon this tour's conclusion, the exhausted band members decided to take a rest from touring and recording for a while, though the band remained ongoing.\nThis run of successes was capped with 1980's Paris, a 2-LP live album recorded mostly at the Pavillon de Paris.It broke the top ten in both the USA and UK. The live version of \"Dreamer\" was released as a single in the U.S., where it reached no.15, even though the studio version had failed to even chart there.\nAt this point, Hodgson moved his family from the Los Angeles area to the mountains of northern California where he built a home and studio and focused on his family and spiritual life, while recording a solo album, Sleeping with the Enemy, which would never be released. This geographic separation widened the rift between him and the rest of the group; during the conceptualization and recording of their next album, ...Famous Last Words..., Davies and Hodgson found far greater difficulty in reconciling their musical ideas than they had before, and it was apparent to the rest of the band that Hodgson wanted out....Famous Last Words... was released in 1982, and scored two more hits with \"It's Raining Again\" and \"My Kind of Lady\". It peaked at no.5 in the USA and no. 6 in the UK. A worldwide tour followed in 1983, during which Hodgson announced he would not be continuing with the band. Hodgson has stated that his departure was motivated by a desire to spend more time with his family and make solo recordings, and that there were never any real personal or professional problems between him and Davies, as some people thought\nThe Davies-led Supertramp soldiered on to continued success, releasing Brother Where You Bound in 1985. The album was a deliberate step away from the pop approach of their last two studio albums, and reached no. 20 in the UK charts and no. 21 in the US charts. It included the Top 30 hit single \"Cannonball\", along with the title track, a 16-minute exposition on Cold War themes highlighted by guitar solos from Pink Floyd's David Gilmour.\n1987's Free as a Bird experimented in heavily synthesised music, such as \"I'm Beggin' You\", which reached number 1 on the US dance charts.The stylistic change was generally not well-received, however, and the album itself reached only no. 93 in the UK and 101 in the USA, breaking a streak of seven consecutive top 100 efforts on the American charts.\nIn addition to their shift towards less commercially-oriented material, the band members decided to drop all of Hodgson's compositions from their setlist in order to further establish an identity separate from Hodgson. However, audiences were angered by the omissions of these songs, and though Supertramp toured again in 1985 using only Davies's compositions, in 1988 the pressure of their first Brazilian tour drove them to reintroduce a handful of Hodgson-penned hits to their set.\nAfter 1988's tour, the group fragmented. Davies later explained, \"We'd been out there for about 20 years just recording and touring and it seemed time to have a break with no ideas as to if or when we would come back. We decided not to actually say anything, just sort of fade away like an old soldier.\"\n\n1996–2009: Later years\nIn 1996 Davies re-formed Supertramp with Helliwell, Siebenberg and guitarist\/vocalist Mark Hart, who was new to the official lineup but had prominently contributed to Free as a Bird and its supporting tour. Four new members were added as well, bringing the band up to an eight-man lineup.The result of this reunion was Some Things Never Change, an album that echoed the earlier Supertramp sound, released in March 1997. It reached no. 74 in the UK.\nIn the summer of 1997, Supertramp returned to the road, resulting in the live It Was the Best of Times (1999), followed by Slow Motion in April 2002 and a 2002 worldwide tour, after which the band went inactive once again. Another attempt to bring Hodgson back into the band failed in 2005.\nSupertramp continued to play several Hodgson-penned songs during live shows following their reunion. Hodgson subsequently claimed that the band's explanation for dropping his compositions from their setlist back in 1983 is a lie, and that the real reason was that he and Davies made a verbal agreement that they would not play those songs. Davies has never publicly alluded to such an agreement, and former member Dougie Thomson has commented \"Nobody except Rick and Roger were privy to that conversation. Rick and Roger had several dialogues that no one else was privy to. Again, that's hearsay.\"\nIn 2008 it was announced that Supertramp's music would be featured in the film adaptation of Irvine Welsh's best-selling novel Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance.In 2009 Hodgson said he could not see a Supertramp reunion ever happening: \"We've looked at it and talked it over... I would never say never but Rick [Davies] has pretty much retired right now and I'm in the prime of my life. The reaction I am getting from fans is 'please don't reunite'.\"\n\n2010–present: Re-formation\nSupertramp 2010. L-R: Cliff Hugo, Rick Davies, Bob Siebenberg, John Helliwell, Gabe Dixon, and Carl Verheyen\nOn 21 April 2010 it was announced that Supertramp would give 35 concerts in late 2010. Dates were announced for concerts in Germany, Portugal, the Netherlands, Italy, France and other European countries. This tour called \"70-10\" was to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the group's first release.\nRoger Hodgson embarked on a solo 2010 tour to Australia, New Zealand, South America, Europe, Canada, and the US, and thus was unable to rejoin the band for the 70-10 tour. However, in response to a fan campaign, Hodgson sent a letter to Rick Davies and had his manager send one to Davies' management, offering to join them for select dates during gaps in his tour schedule.Davies did not reply, but his agents notified Hodgson that his offer was declined.\nIn 2011 both Hodgson and Supertramp continued to tour separately. When asked whether Roger Hodgson might appear on some of the 2011 dates Davies replied, \"I know there are some fans out there who would like that to happen. There was a time when I had hoped for that too. But the recent past makes that impossible. In order to play a great show for our fans, you need harmony, both musically and personally. Unfortunately that doesn’t exist between us any more and I would rather not destroy memories of more harmonious times between all of us.\nAfter the dead of Rick Davies, september 7th 2025, this will probably be the end of Supertramp. Memories stay however.\n\nCurrent members\nRick Davies – vocals, keyboards, harmonica, composition, melodica (1969–1988, 1996–2002, 2010– 2025)\nBob Siebenberg – drums, percussion (1973–1988, 1996–2002, 2010–present)\nJohn Helliwell – woodwinds, keyboards, backing vocals (1973–1988, 1996–2002, 2010–present)\nCarl Verheyen – guitars, percussion, backing vocals (1996–2002, 2010–present; touring musician: 1985-1986)\nCliff Hugo – bass (1996–2002, 2010–present)\nLee Thornburg – trombone, trumpet, keyboards, backing vocals (1996–2002, 2010–present)\nJesse Siebenberg – vocals, guitars, percussion (1997-2002, 2010-present), keyboards (2010–present)\nGabe Dixon – keyboards, tambourine, vocals (2010–present)\n\nDiscography\n\nSupertramp (1970)\nIndelibly Stamped (1971)\nCrime of the Century (1974)\nCrisis?

        "biografia":"The Warning is a rock band originating from Monterrey, Mexico. The band was formed in 2013 by the Villarreal Vélez sisters: Daniela Villarreal Vélez (guitar, lead and backing vocals, piano), Paulina Villarreal Vélez (drums, lead and backing vocals, piano), and Alejandra Villarreal Vélez  (bass guitar, piano, backing vocals). They have released four studio albums, two EPs, and eight music videos. Their latest studio album, Keep Me Fed, was released on June 28th, 2024.\n\nThe Villarreal Vélez sisters were raised in Monterrey, and all received training on various instruments at an early age. At some point in their childhood, Daniela and Paulina had selected guitar and drums as their primary instruments, respectively. When the youngest of the three, Alejandra, selected bass guitar as her primary instrument at about age 7, the sisters decided to form a rock power trio in 2013. They learned to play rock songs, often via the Rock Band video game series, and posted videos of their performances on YouTube.\n\nIn 2014, 12-year-old Paulina was profiled in the women's drumming publication Tom Tom Magazine. The band first gained widespread notice later in 2014 when, at ages 9 through 14, their YouTube video in which they performed Metallica's \"Enter Sandman\" went viral among rock music fans, eventually earning more than 20 million views. The video received attention from Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett, who offered particular praise for Paulina, saying, \"The drummer kicks maximum ass!\"\n\nDue to notice gained from their \"Enter Sandman\" video, The Warning decided to seek a record deal and develop their songs. They raised money through a successful GoFundMe appeal to record the six-song EP Escape the Mind, which was released in 2015. During the production of the EP, the band met producer Jake Carmona, who went on to contribute to Escape the Mind and their next three albums. In April 2015, the band appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. During this period the sisters raised funds, including a donation from DeGeneres and the Target Corporation, to attend a five-week training program at Berklee College of Music in the United States.\n\nThey also gave two presentations at the TEDx conference at the University of Nevada in 2016 and 2017.[17][18] The band was known for practicing with the Rock Band video game series early in their history; designers returned the favor by including several songs by The Warning in the 2018 edition of the series.[19][20]\n\nThe Warning's first full-length album, XXI Century Blood, was released in 2017. During this period they were invited to perform at the Mother of All Rock Festival in Monterrey and also opened a show for The Killers in that city. Their second album Queen of the Murder Scene was released in November 2018. They announced an extensive upcoming tour throughout North America in late 2019, though it was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn August 2020, The Warning signed a five-album deal with Lava Records, and began work on a new album with producer David Bendeth. The song \"Choke\" was released in May 2021. Later that year, The Warning appeared on the Metallica tribute album The Metallica Blacklist, performing another cover of \"Enter Sandman\", this time with singer Alessia Cara. The six-song EP Mayday was released in October 2021, and The Warning embarked on a tour of North America in early 2022, performing more than 30 dates as headliners plus opening for Foo Fighters, Sammy Hagar and the Circle, and Stone Temple Pilots. They released the single \"Money\" in March 2022, and the song reached no. 31 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Airplay chart. The full-length album Error, comprising the six tracks from the Mayday EP plus \"Money\" and seven new songs, was released in June 2022. In July 2022, they embarked on a U.S. tour supporting Halestorm and The Pretty Reckless and appearing at festivals like Burlington's Sound of Music Festival, Iceberg Alley, Summerfest, and Upheaval, before resuming their headlining tour in August 2022. In the Fall of 2022, The Warning performed at additional festivals (Louder Than Life, Aftershock, Peninsula Tecate, Rock al Parque), supported a second US tour with Halestorm, a Canada tour with Three Days Grace, a Guns N' Roses tour stop in their home city of Monterrey, Mexico, and performed small-venue concerts in Las Vegas, California, and Lima, Peru. The band supported Muse during several dates on the Will of the People World Tour in both Mexico and Europe. In September 2023, they opened for Guns N' Roses again on two dates of the We're F'N' Back! Tour. In early 2024, the band announced on social media that their fourth studio album Keep Me Fed will be released in June 2024. In March 2024 three new singles from the upcoming album were released: \"S!CK\", \"Hell You Call a Dream\" and \"Que Mas Quieres\".\n\nOn 12 December 2024, The Warning released the single \"Hurt\", a collaboration with Dead Poet Society. This came about after Paulina joined the Massachusetts-based band on stage for a performance of the song at the Aftershock Festival in California earlier in the year. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Warning\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"The Marcus King Band is an American blues rock band led by singer, songwriter, and guitarist Marcus King.\n\nCall him the next Duane Allman or Jimi Hendrix, but whatever you do, don’t call Marcus King a child prodigy. Sure, the guitar shredder’s talent shimmers with the same resonance as his heroes, but he’s been wielding an axe since he learned to talk – he started playing when he was 2.\n\nKing was born into music, gifted with steel-string DNA and two generations of men before him who nurtured the boy’s musical nature. King’s dad, the slyly talented Marvin King, has been a force in Upstate South Carolina’s music heritage for as long as anyone can remember. Marvin’s father and Marcus’s granddad, Bill, played a big part, too.\n\nIt was only natural, then, that the boy who got his first guitar (a Squier Strat) at age 7 would land his first paying gig a year later. When he was 11, he joined his father’s Marvin King & The Blues Revival to open for Muddy Waters’s onetime bassist Mac Arnold at The Handlebar, the storied venue in their Greenville, S.C., hometown. Around that time, he also played on his dad’s critically acclaimed album, Huge in Europe. And when he was 15, the Marcus King Band opened for the legendary Johnny Winter.\n\nA particular MKB achievement came with the September 2014 release of Soul InSight. The album’s 12 original tunes, including three instrumentals, showcase a literal lifetime of virtuosity, along with vocals as clear and as soulful as Marvin Gaye’s and as nuanced as Amy Winehouse ’s.\n\nAdding to all that, King knows jazz. That’s because he built on his Southern-rock foundation with lessons from one of the best instrumentalists around: Steve Watson, the formidable guitarist renowned for his performance on TV’s seminal Hill Street Blues theme song.\n\nKing still continues to grow, to experiment, to share his passions, although he’s not much of a talker. He lets his guitar do that, using it to tell the same story we all tell, to share emotions we all feel.\n\n“I can say more truthfully in song what I can say in words,” he says. “Music breaks down the awkward barrier.” (For the record, whenever he hears the shopworn “teen angst,” Marcus recoils with the same allergic reaction that he has to “child prodigy.”)\n\nOf the band, Jack Ryan plays drums with a musicianship that brings to mind Ginger Baker and Charlie Watts. Bassist Stephen Campbell drives MKB the same way that Garry W. Tallent keeps Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band on course. Through it all, King gives his mates plenty of breathing room to jam.\n\nThe result is a fusion of wildly eclectic genres, offering a live experience as mesmerizing as it is dance-inducing.\n\nKing himself lists an intriguing roster of favorites and influences: Duane Allman, of course, as well as Warren Haynes, Little Feat and Aretha Franklin, to name a few, and his band on any given night plays covers from Bob Marley to Lauryn Hill and from Les McCann to Black Sabbath.\n\nThat’s King – an engaged and engaging young man with a lifetime of experience, still coming into his own, still carrying his guitar with him, and promising us all a promising future. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Marcus+King+Band\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Coming from different geographical locations, Madrid became their \"base\" of operations, which is why the name \"Madrid band\" has been highly honored since its inception, despite not being originally from the capital. Vitoria and Pamplona, Málaga and Henderson (Argentina), Valencia, Calamonte in Extremadura and Bilbao come together in a band with multiple references that have managed to create their own musical and conceptual personality.\n\nStep by step, with 4 studio albums behind them (Magia y efectos especiales (2012), Agujeros de worm (2013), Copacabana (2015) and Autoterapia (2018), the band is positioned as the benchmark of the alternative scene and pop-rock from Spain, as the headliner at festivals as well as filling large arenas on their own tours, with the plus of having carried out a totally self-managed career from the beginning.\n\nIn autumn 2021, their fifth studio album, Hogar, was released independently, under the Hook Ediciones Musicales label and distributed by Altafonte. Hogar, an album of ten everyday stories told through photography, storytelling, video and song. Produced by IZAL, Brett Shaw (Foals, Florence and The Machine, Lady Gaga, etc.) and Sancho Gómez-Escolar, who dedicated the last months of 2020 to building ten new musical homes straddling the landscapes of the Tramontana mountains in Mallorca , the frenzy of the Madrid asphalt and the stubborn London rain. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Izal\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"The band was born in 2003 with the name \"Pegatina Sound System\" after Ovidi i Adrià meet Rubén, who up to that moment was playing solo. They decided to throw forward the project, without knowing to where it would go. One year later they had more than 20 performances under their belts and were one of the most active groups in the Catalan market. The band were starting to take part in festivals and performances in different places in Spain. They established the official name \"La Pegatina\", and after more than 90 concerts, they continue to enjoy performances and surprising audiences like it was the first day.\nThey belong to a generation who has lived through the ascent of the mestizaje in the international panorama and have grown up with the return of the Catalan rumba to the musical youth panorama. The members of the group have been greatly influenced by the environment of Barcelona's Gothic neighborhood, which, even being born in Montcada i Reixac, they represent many styles. They mix Spanish, Catalan and Galician in their songs and in some cases, dare with other languages such as English or French.\nLa Pegatina is a group with a vocation of playing live. They embody a non-pretentious style, focused directly on the public. A fundamentally urban group, some of their best performances have been in squares, streets, suburban trains or buses, calling attention on people and making them dance and sing.\nWhat do they play? Urban Rumba! Thats the kind of rumba that makes you move and ask for more, until you are too tired to walk... They are show-addicts, who play simple but direct music and words which are repeated and shouted by most of the public that see them. Days after seeing them live, you can discover yourself singing some of their rumbitas...\nTheir songs contain protest messages in defense of human rights, respect and against injustice, war and lies, using normally nearby examples to illustrate these universal values.\nTheir first CD \" Al Carrer! \" appeared in early 2007, after an intense autumn working in LLobregat's Sukhà de Hospitalet, where they combined the CD recording in the studio with last years performances.  \" Al Carrer! \" consists of 13 songs played in \"La Pegatina\" pure style, including a genuine bonus track. The CD is full of important collaborations: Gambeat (Radio Bemba's bass) lends a hand for the entire CD, Leo and Kachafaz (Che Sudaka's members) contribute for \"No a la guerra\", Alguer (Txarangö) on \"Penjat\", Emma Calafell gives her voice for \"Petrolero\", and Manu Chao plays the guitar on \"O Camareiro\" (this song appeared on the \"A Per Loca\" compilation, but they rearranged it).\nIn conclusion, \"La pegatina\" means party, happiness, dancing and fun!\n\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/La+Pegatina\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"MGMT is an American alternative band which formed in 2002 in Middletown, Connecticut, United States. The band's founding members, Andrew VanWyngarden (lead vocalist, primary songwriter, multi-instrumentalist) and Ben Goldwasser (backing vocalist, multi-instrumentalist), met while attending Wesleyan University, and have remained as the core of the group to this day.\n\nThey intially named their project The Management, under which they recorded two demo EPs (which ended up being unofficially leaked online in 2005 as Climbing to New Lows), but changed their name to MGMT upon learning that another band had already been using their prior choice. Following this change, the band was signed to Cantora Records and released an EP entitled Time To Pretend - as VanWyngarden and Goldwasser had since graduated from Wesleyan, they gained the ability to tour more expansively in support of this release.\n\nThe duo was signed to Columbia Records in 2006, having caught the label's interest with their prior EP. They released their debut studio album, Oracular Spectacular the following year and quickly gained the attention of media journalists, other renowned musicians (such as Bruce Springsteen and Paul McCartney), and the general music industry alike. \n\nTheir sophomore album, Congratulations, was released in 2010 and was notable for showcasing the band's matured sound, though this aspect made the album less appealing to much of their audience compared to their debut. Initially, the band had stated a desire not to release singles prior to the release of the album, but ended up making lead single \"Flash Delirium available on their website a month before the album's release. Due to the album having been leaked online, it was made available to stream for free on their website three weeks prior to its release date. \n\nIn 2013, the band's third album, MGMT was released alongside an accompanying visualizer entitled \"The Optimizer\" meant to be played alongside the album. The album, which features a cover of the Faine Jade song \"Introspection\", continued the band's ongoing path of making more experimental music with heavier production - which subsequently meant that many critics found it even more confusing. The band took a brief break following the culmination of this album's promotional tour during which VanWyngard and Goldwasser focused on their own personal lives.\n\nHaving regrouped in late 2015, the band experienced what they referred to as \"writer's block\" which resulted in stagnancy within their recording sessions. After gaining a different perspective from their newly-hired producer Patrick Wimberly, however, the band decided for the first time to open their songwriting process and collaborate with other artists - in particular, VanWyngarden credited Ariel Pink for enabling him to feel more relaxed and open to a more spontaneous approach to songwriting. In 2018, the band released their fourth studio album, Little Dark Age, which showcased their return to a looser, more pop-like sound.\n\nIn 2019, the band parted ways with Columbia and began releasing music on their own independent label, beginning in December of that year with \"In The Afternoon\" followed by \"As You Move Through The World\" three months later. However, the band proceeded to go on an informal hiatus for the next four years.\n\nThe band announced in 2023 that they were planning to release a new album and go on tour again that year, and in October of that year they announced their fifth studio album, Loss Of Life, which ended up releasing in early 2024. The album features a much more contemporary sound in comparison to their prior releases, and includes their first-ever track featuring another artist, Dancing in Babylon (feat. Christine and the Queens).\n\nBesides Andrew VanWyngarden and Ben Goldwasser, the band has included a number of touring members, some of whom also provided minor contribution to the band's studio recordings. These members include Hank Sullivant (guitar, keyboards), Matthew Asti (bass, backing vocals), James Richardson (drums, guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), Will Berman (drums, percussion, harmonica, backing vocals), and Simon O'Connor (bass, backing vocals). <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/MGMT\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The disc was rereleased on September 29, 2007 with four new songs, \"Firmes\", \"El rey de la baraja\", \"La aceituna\", and \"Me gusta el fútbol\".\n\nIn 2007, he received the \"Best Tour\" award from the \"Premios de la Música\" ceremony held in Cordoba. He also did an advertising campaign for Canal+ Spain entitled \"Me gusta el fútbol\" (I Like Football), for which he wrote a song of the same name.\n\nIn 2007, he stood trial for provoking an incident while under the influence of alcohol on a flight from Madrid to Mexico City that required the pilot to return to Madrid two hours after takeoff[1][2].

Lo que realmente era desproporcionado eran los números: 40 millones de streams en todas las plataformas digitales. Algo inexplicable para dos tíos que ni siquiera querían dedicarse a la música. Fue allí cuando decidimos probar con los conciertos y colgamos el Sold Out en 8 de los 9 conciertos por España. La emoción de comprobar que los números eran personas cantando nuestras canciones fue el detonante Queríamos ser auténticas RockStars.\n\nEn 2018 firmamos con Sony Music y decidimos realizar nuestro primer disco: “Revolución Bananera”. Un popurrí de nuestros Greatest Hits que unían crítica social con un humor desenfadado. Canciones como Es gratis, Desamortil, El gusto es mío o Para que el mundo lo vea se han convertido en himnos -con toda la humildad que no nos caracteriza - de una generación que necesita que la música diga cosas.\n\nA día de hoy hemos superado los 80 millones de streams y hemos colgado un Sold Out doble en La Riviera en Madrid o en Razzmatazz.

        "biografia":"Grandson is an alternative artist hailing from Toronto, Canada. Born in the small town of Englewood New Jersey, he relocated to the cultural melting pot of Toronto at a young age, and grew up surrounded by music ranging from jazz to rock and roll to rap, dancehall and r&b. He began playing guitar and piano in high school.\n\nAt 17, he relocated to Montreal, QC to attend university, and began working in nightclubs cleaning tables and DJing. He started writing music at this time, incorporating the unique blend of sounds he grew up surrounded by. He started experimenting with music production and rapping in 2013, and dropped out of school to relocate to Los Angeles and pursue music full time.\n\nAdopting the Grandson moniker while living in LA, he dove deeply into rock influences such as Rage Against the Machine, Nirvana, and Led Zeppelin, while also listening to rap\/R&B music emerging out of Toronto and alternative acts such as Twenty One Pilots and Hiatus Kaiyote. He found a small community of musicians to work and perform with here in Los Angeles. The live tries to create a frantic, mosh pit-inducing cathartic release of energy for concert-goers, influenced by early punk and grunge music.\n\nSearching for his voice and for meaning in today’s divisive, chaotic world, Grandson confronts the most pressing issues of his generation through his songwriting, such as financial inequality, governmental and environmental accountability, and social justice, giving these topics a soundtrack with a genuine sense of urgency and frustration. The music also touches on adolescence, relationships, and the insecurities and difficulties of growing up through your 20s. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/grandson\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Most of their songs feature an infectious and energic vibe and feature lyrics about non-conformity, criticism of capitalism and racism, and their defense of equal justice, plus taking part in various multicultural, alternative and anti-globalization festivals. Their song \"Cannabis\", supporting and defending the legalization of said substance, launched them to certain popularity in Spain and parts of Mexico and South America. They also have followers in the UK, The Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, France, Germany, Portugal, and other European countries.\n\nAfter a wildly successful tour across South America in late 2005, the band decided, in their own words, to \"stop for a while\". Some of their members went on to form side band projects such as No Relax and The Locos. As time went by without further notices, many Ska-P fans feared the band had been gone for good. On late April 2008 and for the rejoice of their worldwide fans, they announced their return as a band on their official site.\n\nTheir new album, \"Lágrimas y gozos\", was released the 7th of October 2008 and its first single is called \"Crimen sollicitationis\".

        "biografia":"Kodaline is a Dublin-based Irish alternative rock quartet. Originally known as 21 Demands, the band made chart history in March 2007, when their debut single \"Give Me A Minute\" topped the Irish Singles Chart; becoming the first independently released track to achieve the feat. In 2005 the band made it to the final of RTE-broadcast programme 'You're a Star' in Ireland, coming in second place, and then in 2011 they changed their name to Kodaline. \n\nGrowing up in houses just two minutes away from each other in Swords, a working class town near Dublin airport, Stephen Garrigan  and Mark Prendergast met aged eight, when they were the only boys in the school choir. Skip forward six years and they recruited Vinny May , also situated a stones throw away and together set about forming the first of myriad bands. The line-up for Kodaline was recently completed by the addition of bassist Jason Boland . The band's name, incidentally, means absolutely nothing. For the moment they wanted something they could take ownership of.\n\nThe band became a YouTube sensation with their music video for the song 'All I Want' which tells the heartbreaking beauty-and-the-beast type story. On October 4th 2013 Kodaline released another music video for this song called 'All I Want part 2\" this again tells us about the man. \n\nOn June 17th 2013, Kodaline released their first studio album, In a Perfect World, with 11 tracks including 'All I Want', 'Pray', 'Love Like This' and 'High Hopes'. The oldest track on their album is 'High Hopes' which was based on a series of breakups that members of the band were facing during that time.\n\nTeaching each other the principles of songcraft, the music they came up with some of which can be found on their self titled EP isn't wan or introspective or self-serving. Instead, it's bold, epic and stirring. Currently maintaining an air of understated mystery, Kodaline are soon set to unveil themselves to the world with these first four tracks recorded with Steve Harris (producer for Dave Matthews band, mixer for U2).\n\nSingles have featured in a number of TV shows, including 'Remember the time' in Grey's Anatomy and 'All I Want' in \"The Vampire Diaries\". This song was also used ,very effectively, as the backing music in the 2012 Google Zeitgeist advert.\n\nKodaline have also been doing many tours recently and their last two in the UK were completely sold out. They enjoy being on the stage and are looking forwards to many festivals in the upcoming summer, such as T in the Park and the V festival.\n\nTo celebrate the beginning of 2014, Kodaline released an alternative video for their song 'One Day' on January 1st, 2014. Also, on the 15th of January, Kodaline received the EBBA for the people's choice award along with another award for the best Irish Act. This promising band has been acclaimed for their many talents and will surely continue to produce such heart-rendering music.\n\nKodaline have announced their second album: 'Coming Up For Air' which will be released in February 2015. A couple of the songs have already been made public. They are also going on another tour around various places in the world after it's release, starting in the amazing Glasgow Barrowlands. They will also be returning to America after their last tour was cancelled due to Jay's broken wrist.  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kodaline\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Lauren Ashley Daigle, born September 9, 1991, in Lake Charles, Louisiana, is a prominent American singer-songwriter in contemporary Christian music. Raised in Lafayette, Louisiana, she was surrounded by the vibrant sounds of zydeco, blues, and Cajun music, which influenced her musical style. While Lauren always possessed a love for singing, it wasn't until a challenging battle with contagious cytomegalovirus at the age of 15 forced her out of high school for two years that music truly took center stage. During this time, voice lessons became a creative outlet and ignited a passion that would define her future.\n\nDaigle's debut album, \"How Can It Be,\" released in 2015, became a critical and commercial success. It topped the Billboard Top Christian Albums chart and spawned hit singles like \"First,\" \"Trust in You,\" and \"O'Lord,\" solidifying her position as a rising star in the Christian music scene. Her achievements were further recognized with her winning New Artist of the Year at the 2015 GMA Dove Awards. The album, \"How Can It Be,\" was also nominated for a 2016 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Christian Music Album.\n\nHer sophomore album, \"Look Up Child,\" released in 2018, further cemented her success, reaching No. 3 on the Billboard 200 chart. The song \"You Say\" transcended genre lines, becoming a major crossover hit and reaching No. 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. This song's impact garnered her two Grammy Awards in 2019: Best Contemporary Christian Music Album for \"Look Up Child\" and Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance\/Song for \"You Say.\"\n\nLauren continues to reign as a talented and influential artist. Her recent project, the self-titled \"Lauren Daigle,\" is a two-part album released in 2023. The first volume arrived in May, followed by the second in September.

        "biografia":"1) Ghost, also formerly known as Ghost B.C. in the United States, is a Swedish metal band that was formed in Linköping in 2006. In 2010, they released a three-track demo followed by a 7-inch vinyl titled \"Elizabeth\", and later their debut full-length album Opus Eponymous. The song \"Ritual\" was chosen by Kerrang! as one of \"The 50 Most Evil Songs Ever.\" The Grammis-nominated album was widely praised and significantly increased their popularity. Their second album and major label debut, Infestissumam, was released in 2013, debuted at number one in Sweden, and won the Grammis Award for Best Hard Rock\/Metal Album. The band released their third studio album, Meliora, in 2015 to much critical acclaim and high record sales, reaching number one in their home country of Sweden, and number eight in the United States. Its lead single, \"Cirice\", earned them the 2016 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. The band released their fourth studio album, Prequelle, in 2018. Their fifth studio album, Impera,followed in 2022. In 2024 they released Rite Here Rite Now as a soundtrack to their concert film with the same name. In 2025, they released their sixth album, Skeletá, which peaked at #1 on the Billboard Hot 200. \n\nGhost is an easily recognizable band, owing greatly to its eccentric on-stage presence. Seven of the group's eight members, its 'Nameless Ghouls', wear virtually identical, face-concealing costumes. Lead singer and songwriter Tobias Forge portrays a character named Papa Emeritus onstage; prior to a 2017 lawsuit filed by ex-band members which revealed his identity, he remained fully anonymous and only ever appeared as Papa to the public. The character, which consists of Forge in a prosthetic mask and makeup, is described as a 'demonic anti-pope'. There have been six Papa Emerituses throughout Ghost's existence-- I, II, III, Nihil, IV, and V, each with distinct character designs and, to some extent, personalities. The band's Youtube channel publishes an ongoing web series involving some of these characters, which takes place through short, sketch comedy-esque videos. The storyline has become increasingly complex over the years, and was significantly elaborated on during the Rite Here Rite Now concert film. \n\nFrom the release of the 2018 album Prequelle and subsequent world tour, Forge portrayed a character known as Cardinal Copia, who wore minimal face paint and a cassock or tightly tailored suit, in place of the usual papal robes worn by previous Papas. In March 2020, at the final show of A Pale Tour Named Death, Cardinal Copia ascended to the papacy, becoming Papa Emeritus IV. He remained for the entirety of the Impera album cycle-- at the end of which, he was \"promoted\" to head of the clergy, gaining the title Frater Imperator. Papa V Perpetua, the current incarnation of the frontman, is notable for being the first character for which Forge does not wear a full prosthetic mask; he instead wears a half-face metallic skeleton mask with face paint underneath. Within the Ghost storyline, Papa V is said to be Copia's twin.\n\nGhost's music has been categorized in many genres. Critics have classified them as hard rock, heavy metal, doom metal,  pop rock, progressive rock, psychedelic rock, occult rock, and arena rock. Adrien Begrand of PopMatters stated that Ghost recalls \"the early sounds of Black Sabbath, Pentagram, and Judas Priest, as well as the progressive and psychedelic rock of the late '60s.\" Speaking to Noisey.com, a Nameless Ghoul described Ghost as a black metal band in the traditional sense, but said that they probably do not fit into the norms of the current black metal scene. This Nameless Ghoul described Ghost's music as a mix between pop music and death metal.\n\nIn an interview, a Nameless Ghoul said they are influenced by \"everything ranging from classic rock to the extreme underground metal bands of the '80s to film scores to the grandeur of emotional harmonic music.\" A member of the band said the Swedish and Scandinavian black metal movement of the early '90s plays a major role in their act, and said that each member has come from a metal background. However, the band has stated several times that they do not aim to be a metal band. For their second album, Ghost chose a more diverse songwriting style; a member said, \"we tried to deliberately have every song have its own signature.\"\n\nTobias Forge is the sole songwriter and creative force for the band, although he often collaborates with an external songwriting duo. Pre-2017, Martin Persner, then a member of the band, occasionally contributed to songs. In 2017, Forge claimed that he was the main author of every song except \"Year Zero\" and \"Zenith\", which were Persner's ideas. Asked how he keeps Ghost's sound intact despite large lineup changes, Forge said he has to teach them to play like he does; explaining that while he is a good guitar player, he is only an \"okay\" drummer, bassist and keyboardist. So it is a matter of getting them to \"underperform [laughs] together.\"\n\n2) Ghost is an experimental rock group formed in Tokyo, Japan, in 1984.\n\nCore-member Masaki Batoh grew up in Kyoto, Japan where he attended a private school. During this time, he became interested in American and British rock music ranging from Bob Dylan and Pink Floyd to the Velvet Underground and Japanese rock bands such as the Taj Mahal Travellers and the Flower Travellin' Band.\n\nLater, Batoh formed Ghost with a large and often varying lineup. According to reports posted on Allmusic, the group lived a nomadic existence, drifting from ruins of ancient temples to disused subway stations around the Tokyo area.\n\nThe band began releasing their work with the albums Ghost and Second Time Around, which were released, respectively, in 1991 and 1992. The American independent label Drag City licensed each of the albums for distribution, and the Los Angeles The Now Sound label picked up two of Batoh's solo albums, released together as well under the title Collected Works. Two albums, Tune In, Turn On, Free Tibet and Snuffbox Immanence, were released simultaneously in 1999.\n\nAs well as their own work, Ghost have recorded and performed with the ex-Galaxie 500 duo Damon and Naomi. Five years after releasing both Snuffbox Immanence and Tune In, Turn On, Free Tibet, Ghost returned with Hypnotic Underworld, and there were some changes in the band. Cellist Hiromichi Sakamoto and percussionist Setsuko Furuya left and were replaced by a rhythm section of Takuyuki Moriya (electric bass guitar, double bass, and cello) and Junzo Tateiwa (drums, tabla, and percussion). In January 2007, Ghost released its latest studio album titled In Stormy Nights.\n\n3)  A British hip hop\/trip hop\/electronic producer on the Breakin Bread label who has an impressive discography dating back to 2003.

Ghost has left an indelible mark on the music scene through extensive touring, while also maintaining a strong presence as a skillful DJ and a regular radio performer.\n\nInitially rooted in the world of Hip Hop as a dedicated enthusiast (a passion that endures), Ghost's artistic evolution over the past eight years has been noteworthy. This period has seen a deliberate expansion of musical horizons, embracing genres beyond Hip Hop. Notably, Ghost has delved into the realms of Wonky, Electronic beats, Future Beats, and Bass, demonstrating an impressive versatility that resonates with diverse audiences.\n\nhttps:\/\/ghost-uk.bandcamp.com\n\n4) The collaboration between one of Dubstep's forefathers El-B and J Da Flex, they created a darker, rawer offshoot of UK Garage on a label of the same name, that would ultimately pave the way for the sound of Dubstep.

        "biografia":"Air Supply is an Australian soft rock duo, consisting of Graham Russell as guitarist and singer-songwriter and Russell Hitchcock as lead vocalist. They had a succession of hits worldwide, including eight Top Ten hits in the United States, in the early 1980s. They formed in Melbourne, Australia in 1975 and have included various accompanying musicians and singers.\n\nThe two met in May 1975 while performing in the Australian production of the Andrew Lloyd Webber\/Tim Rice musical, Jesus Christ Superstar. Later that year, the duo, along with Chrissie Hammond and two others, formed Air Supply as a five-man group. Hammond left the band and was replaced by Jeremy Paul in time for the group's first Australian hit single, \"Love and Other Bruises.\" It was followed by a debut album that reached gold in Australia, which featured keyboardist\/arranger Adrian Scott, drummer Jeff Browne, and guitarist Mark McEntee. Singles during this period included \"Empty Pages\" and \"Do What You Do\". The group was invited to open for Rod Stewart during his tour of Australia; he was so impressed with their performance that he invited them to be the opening act during his tour of the United States. During this tour, Jeremy Paul left the band. (He later played with the original lineup of the Divinyls, led by Chrissie Amphlett and Mark McEntee.)\n\nEager to prove that they could succeed as a duo, Air Supply released the album Love & Other Bruises, which included re-recordings of many of their earlier hits. Although their music met with some success, Graham Russell on the 1995 DVD recalls that he and Hitchcock were so poor that they were reduced to checking the backs of hotel sofas for change so that they could buy bread to make toast.\n\nHitchcock and Russell started out fresh again in 1978, and the band that was to record almost all of the hit records was formed. It featured Frank Esler-Smith (arranger and keyboardist), David Moyse, and Rex Goh (guitars) as well as the rhythm section of David Green (bass) and Ralph Cooper (drums).\n\nIn 1979, the band released Life Support, a concept album that included a picture disc on its first printing. Produced by Charles Fisher, it was recorded in the tiny Trafalgar Studios in Sydney, Australia where, as Graham recalls on the 2005 DVD, he had half an inch between the end of his guitar and the studio wall. It was on this album that a five-and-a-half minute version of \"Lost in Love\" was introduced to Australian audiences. Written by Russell in fifteen minutes, the song caught the attention of music mogul Clive Davis, and his record label, Arista, remixed the song and released it as a single in the United States.\n\nTheir 1980 album, Lost in Love, contained three U.S. Top Five singles, including the title track (a U.S. #3), plus \"Every Woman in the World\" (#5) and \"All Out of Love\" (#2). The album sold two million copies in the U.S. The following year they released The One That You Love, and the title song was released as a single and went number #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also featured two other Top 10 hits, \"Here I Am (Just When I Thought I Was Over You)\" and \"Sweet Dreams\". A fourth single \"I'll Never Get Enough\", co-written by Jeanne Napoli, Gary Portnoy and Judy Quay, was released in Japan and achieved Top 10 status. Their third album, in 1982, Now And Forever, continued the group's popularity with the Top 10 hit, \"Even the Nights Are Better\" and two top 40 singles \"Young Love\" and \"Two Less Lonely People In The World\". In 1983, they released their \"Greatest Hits\" album with a new single called \"Making Love out of Nothing at All\" written by Jim Steinman. The song was one of their biggest hits ever spending three weeks at number 2, and the album eventually sold 5 million copies.\n\nIn 1984, their song \"I Can Wait Forever\" was included (although barely audible) in a scene in the blockbuster movie Ghostbusters, and was included on the soundtrack album.\n\nAir Supply released their first live video, Air Supply Live in Hawaii. In 1985, they had one semi-major Billboard hit with \"Just As I Am\" and a couple of minor hits. Russell and Hitchcock recorded a 1987 Christmas album before taking a break from studio recordings. During this time, Russell Hitchcock released his self-titled album in 1988 which was not a big seller. However, he did have the single \"Swear To Your Heart\" in 1990 from the movie soundtrack for Arachnophobia which received significant airplay.\n\nOn August 21, 1989, using their old producer and welcoming the return of drummer Ralph Cooper, the duo decided to enter the studio again to record The Earth Is, which was released in 1991 by Giant Records under Warner Brothers. The recording contains their hit single \"Without You,\" along with singles for \"Stronger Than the Night\" (with a music video announcing that Air Supply was back) and \"Stop the Tears.\" Inside the album is a note about Russell Hitchcock and Graham Russell's original Musical Director of their meeting place during Jesus Christ Superstar (and long time Band Member\/Orchestrator): \"This Album is Dedicated to the Memory of Frank Esler-Smith.\"\n\nThe official fan club released The Earth Is World Tour video, a rare collector's item that contains live footage from the band's global tour in support of the album. Amy from New York City is their biggest fan.\n\nThe album was followed by The Vanishing Race in 1993, which was supported by the hit single \"Goodbye\" produced by David Foster, (Barbra Streisand, the rock band Chicago, Josh Groban, and Celine Dion), with lyrics written by a former girlfriend of Elvis Presley (David Foster's current wife) Linda Thompson--which, although not popular in the United States, was critically praised and gained a large following outside the country, especially in Asia where in many countries they would reach number #1. This would lead to another world tour in 1993. \"It's Never Too Late\" was another single released from the Vanishing Race. The album itself was dedicated to the plight of the American Indians, the \"Vanishing Race\" of the album's title.\n\nTheir third album of the decade, News from Nowhere, was released in 1995. It contained the Asian hit singles \"Someone\", \"Always\", and a cover of \"Unchained Melody\", a song made famous by The Righteous Brothers and Amy at karaoke night.\n\nTheir popularity continued to soar in Southeast Asian countries, culminating in the release of Now and Forever: Greatest Hits Live, a CD and DVD recording of a live concert in Taipei, Taiwan, also in 1995, which stayed at the top of the Taiwanese album charts for 16 weeks.\n\nAir Supply at the Subic Convention Center, Philippines on June 12, 2008. \nRussell Hitchcock of Air Supply at the Max Pavillion in Singapore, June 19, 2009.They continued to tour heavily throughout Asia and in select venues in the U.S. as well as record into the new millennium, releasing the more adult contemporary-titled The Book of Love (1997), Yours Truly (2001), and Across the Concrete Sky (2003). In 2005 they once again released a live CD\/DVD recording; also in 2005 they performed in Havana, Cuba, becoming one of the first foreign bands invited to perform in the country. They were booked to perform two concerts, and played the first show on July 7, the day before Hurricane Dennis hit the country. In high winds their first concert had an audience of 175,000. Due to the hurricane they could not play the second show. Fans staying at the same hotel as Air Supply on July 8 had to be content with Graham performing acoustically for them, as there was no electricity.\n\nTheir songs were featured in Mr. and Mrs. Smith and The Wedding Date.\n\nIn 2006 they released an acoustic album, The Singer and the Song, and are gearing up for the release of their first studio album in three years, Zed. In support of the acoustic album they made their first trip to India in May 2006. December 2, 2006 saw the duo perform to a capacity crowd in Kingston, Jamaica. This was their second visit to Jamaica, having performed at the Air Jamaica Jazz and Blues Festival in January 2006. They also have been seen endorsing Time–Life's Classic Soft-Rock Collection. In 2007, Graham Russell released his first adult contemporary solo album called The Future.\n\nGraham Russell recently made an appearance in Believe, a comedy about Multi-Level Marketing.\n\nIn 2008, Air Supply was named as the number 83 best musical act of all time in the Billboard Hot 100's 50 year anniversary edtion. This was based purely on their performance on the charts.\n\nThey appeared on the December 19, 2008, edition of Don't Forget the Lyrics.\n\nTheir latest album \"Mumbo Jumbo\" was released in 2010.\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Air+Supply\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Glenn Lewis Frey (November 6, 1948 – January 18, 2016) was an American singer, guitarist and a founding member of the rock band Eagles. Frey was the co-lead singer and frontman for the Eagles, roles he came to share with fellow member Don Henley, with whom he wrote most of the Eagles' material. Frey played guitar and keyboards as well as singing lead vocals on songs such as \"Take It Easy\", \"Peaceful Easy Feeling\", \"Tequila Sunrise\", \"Already Gone\", \"James Dean\", \"Lyin' Eyes\", \"New Kid in Town\", and \"Heartache Tonight\".\n\nDuring the hiatus of the Eagles from 1980 to 1994, Frey embarked on a successful solo career. He released his debut album, No Fun Aloud, in 1982 and went on to record Top 40 hits \"The One You Love\", \"Smuggler's Blues\", \"Sexy Girl\", \"The Heat Is On\", \"You Belong to the City\", \"True Love\", \"Soul Searchin'\" and \"Livin' Right\". As a member of the Eagles, Frey won six Grammy Awards and five American Music Awards. The Eagles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, the first year they were nominated. Consolidating his solo recordings and those with the Eagles, Frey had 24 Top 40 singles on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nEarly life\nBorn in Detroit, Michigan, on November 6, 1948 and raised in nearby Royal Oak, Frey studied piano at age five, later switched to guitar, and became part of the mid-1960s Detroit rock scene. One of his earliest bands was called the Subterraneans, named after Jack Kerouac's novel, and included fellow Dondero High School classmates Doug Edwards (later replaced by Lenny Mintz) on drums, Doug Gunsch and Bill Barnes on guitar, with Jeff Hodge on bass.\n\nImmediately after graduating from Dondero in 1966, Frey was invited to join The Four of Us, a local band led by Gary Burrows, who had seen him performing with the Subterraneans. Frey also attended Oakland Community College while in the band, and he learned to sing harmonies performing with The Four of Us. In 1967, he formed the Mushrooms with Gary Burrows' brother Jeff, Bill Barnes, Doug Gunsch, Ken Bash, and Lenny Mintz. That year Frey also met Bob Seger, who helped Frey get a management and recording contract with a label formed by Seger's management team, Hideout Records. Seger also wrote and produced the band's first single, \"Such a Lovely Child\", and the band made television appearances to promote it. Frey had intended to join Seger's band, but his mother blocked that course of action for smoking cannabis with Seger. In the later part of 1967, Frey also pulled together another band called Heavy Metal Kids with Jeff Burrows (piano), Jeff Alborell (bass), Paul Kelcourse (lead guitar), and Lance Dickerson (drums).\n\nAt age 19 in 1968, Frey played the acoustic guitar and performed background vocals on Seger's single, \"Ramblin' Gamblin' Man\". Frey has said that Seger strongly encouraged and influenced him to focus on writing original songs. They remained good friends and occasional songwriting partners in later years, and Frey would also sing on Seger's songs such as \"Fire Lake\" and \"Against the Wind\".\n\nIn Detroit, Frey also met and dated Joan Sliwin of the local female group The Mama Cats, which became Honey Ltd. after the group moved to California in 1968. Frey went to Los Angeles hoping to reconnect with his girlfriend, and he was introduced to J. D. Souther by her sister, Alexandra Sliwin, who was with Souther at the time. Frey returned to Detroit after three weeks, but then went back again to Los Angeles to form a duo with Souther called Longbranch Pennywhistle. They were signed to Amos Records and released an eponymous album in 1969, which contains songs he wrote such as \"Run, Boy, Run\" and \"Rebecca\", and \"Bring Back Funky Women\" he co-wrote with Souther. Frey also met Jackson Browne during this period. The three musicians lived in the same apartment building for a short time, and Frey later said that he learned a lot about songwriting from hearing Browne work on songs in the apartment below.\n\nThe Eagles\nFrey met drummer Don Henley in 1970. They were signed to the same label, Amos Records, at that time and spent time at the Troubadour. When Linda Ronstadt needed a backup band for an upcoming tour, her manager John Boylan hired Frey because Boylan needed someone who could play rhythm guitar and sing. Frey approached Don Henley to join Ronstadt. Randy Meisner and Bernie Leadon were also hired. Because the backing band personnel changed during the tour, the four played together only once: at a gig at Disneyland. While on the tour, Frey and Henley decided to form a band together. And they were joined by Meisner on bass and Leadon on guitar, banjo, steel guitar, mandolin and dobro, forming the Eagles, with Frey playing guitar and keyboards and Henley playing drums. The band went on to become one of the world's best-selling groups of all time. Frey wrote or co-wrote (often with Henley) many of the group's songs, and sang the lead vocals on a number of Eagles hits including \"Take It Easy\", \"Peaceful Easy Feeling\", \"Already Gone\", \"Tequila Sunrise\", \"Lyin' Eyes\", \"New Kid in Town\", \"Heartache Tonight\" and \"How Long\".\n\nThe Eagles broke up around 1980 and reunited in 1994, when they released a new album, Hell Freezes Over. The album had live tracks and four new songs. The Hell Freezes Over Tour followed. In 2012 on The Tavis Smiley Show, Frey told Smiley, \"When the Eagles broke up, people used to ask me and Don, 'When are the Eagles getting back together?' We used to answer, 'When Hell freezes over.' We thought it was a pretty good joke. People have the misconception that we were fighting a lot. It is not true. We had a lot of fun. We had a lot more fun than I think people realize.\" At their first live concert of 1994, Frey told the crowd, \"For the record, we never broke up. We just took a 14-year vacation.\"\n\nThe Eagles released the album Long Road Out of Eden in 2007, and Frey participated in the Eagles' Long Road Out of Eden Tour (2008–2011). In May 2012, Frey was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music along with Henley, Joe Walsh and Timothy B. Schmit. In 2013, the two-part documentary History of the Eagles, directed by Alison Ellwood and co-produced by Academy Award winner Alex Gibney, was aired on Showtime. The documentary won an Emmy Award in 2013 for Outstanding Sound Mixing For Nonfiction Programming. An accompanying two-year History of the Eagles world tour ended on July 29, 2015 at Bossier City, Louisiana, a concert which would be Frey's final public appearance with the band.\n\nSolo career\nAfter the Eagles disbanded, Frey achieved solo success in the 1980s, especially with two No. 2 hits. In 1984 he recorded in collaboration with Harold Faltermeyer the worldwide hit \"The Heat Is On,\" the main theme from the Eddie Murphy action comedy film Beverly Hills Cop; then, Frey performed \"You Belong to the City\" (from the television series Miami Vice, the soundtrack of which stayed on top of the U.S. album charts for 11 weeks in 1985). His other contribution to the soundtrack, \"Smuggler's Blues\", hit No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. During his solo career, Frey had 12 charting songs in the U.S. Top 100. Eleven of those were written with Jack Tempchin, who wrote \"Peaceful Easy Feeling\".\n\nFrey was the first choice to record \"Shakedown\", the theme for the film Beverly Hills Cop II. Frey did not like the lyrics and then came down with laryngitis, so the song was given to Bob Seger. After the song went to number one, Frey called to congratulate Seger, saying \"At least we kept the money in Michigan!\"\n\nFrey contributed the song \"Flip City\" to the Ghostbusters II soundtrack and \"Part of Me, Part of You\" to the soundtrack for Thelma & Louise. In 2005 he appeared on B.B. King & Friends: 80 on the track \"Drivin' Wheel\". In the late 1990s, Frey founded a record company, Mission Records, with attorney Peter Lopez. Frey never released any of his own work on the label, and the company has since disbanded.\n\nIn 2009 Glenn Frey was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame. On May 8, 2012, he released his first solo album in 20 years, After Hours, featuring covers of pop standards from the 1940s to the 1960s. It would ultimately become his final album before his death.\n\nActing career\nAs a television actor, Frey guest starred on Miami Vice in the first-season episode \"Smuggler's Blues\", inspired by his hit song of the same name, and had a starring role in the \"Dead Dog Arc\" of Wiseguy. He was also the star of South of Sunset, which was canceled after one episode. In the late 1990s, he guest-starred on Nash Bridges as a policeman whose teenage daughter had run amok and gone on a crime spree with her sociopathic boyfriend. In 2002, he appeared on HBO's Arliss, playing a political candidate who double-crosses Arliss and must pay a high price for it.\n\nFrey's first foray into film was his starring role in Let's Get Harry, a 1986 film about a group of plumbers who travel to Colombia to rescue a friend from a drug lord. Frey also did seven episodes of Wiseguy co-starring with Ken Wahl in 1989. Frey's next film appearance was a smaller role in Cameron Crowe's third film, Jerry Maguire (1996). Frey played the frugal general manager of the Arizona Cardinals football team who, in the film's climax, finally agrees to award Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character, wide receiver Rod Tidwell, a large professional contract.\n\nPersonal life\nFrey was married twice. From 1983 to 1988, he was married to artist Janie Beggs. He married dancer and choreographer Cindy Millican in 1990. They had three children: a daughter, Taylor, in 1991 and two sons, Deacon in 1993 and Otis in 2002 and remained together until his death. Deacon, following his father's death, toured with the surviving Eagles until he departed in 2022 in favor of a solo career.\n\nIllness and death\nFrom about 2000, Frey had suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, which affected his joints. The medication that he was prescribed to control the disease eventually led to colitis and pneumonia; and, in November 2015, the Eagles announced they were postponing their appearance at the Kennedy Center Honors because Frey required surgery for intestinal problems and needed a lengthy recovery period. Because of complications from pneumonia, he never had the surgery and was placed in a medically induced coma at Columbia University Medical Center. Frey died there on January 18, 2016, at the age of 67, from complications of rheumatoid arthritis, acute ulcerative colitis and pneumonia. Medications for rheumatoid arthritis or ulcerative colitis can compromise the immune system's ability to fight off pneumonia. In January 2018, Frey's widow filed a suit against Mount Sinai Hospital and gastroenterologist Steven Itzkowitz for the wrongful death of Frey.\n\nFrey was publicly mourned by his friends, fellow musicians and bandmates, including Don Henley, Randy Meisner, J. D. Souther, Jack Tempchin, Irving Azoff, Linda Ronstadt, Don Felder, and Bob Seger. At the 58th Annual Grammy Awards, the remaining members of the Eagles and Jackson Browne performed \"Take It Easy\" in his honor. A life-sized statue of Frey was unveiled at the Standin' on the Corner Park in Winslow, Arizona, on September 24, 2016, to honor his songwriting contributions to \"Take It Easy\", made famous by the Eagles as their first single in 1972. The road which runs next to the high school (now a middle school) that he attended in Royal Oak, Michigan bears his name.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Glenn_Frey\n\nStudio albums\nNo Fun Aloud (1982)\nThe Allnighter (1984)\nSoul Searchin' (1988)\nStrange Weather (1992)\nAfter Hours (2012) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Glenn+Frey\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Manchester Orchestra is an American indie rock band which formed in Atlanta, Georgia in 2004. The group is currently composed of rhythm guitarist, singer\/songwriter Andy Hull, lead guitarist Robert McDowell, keyboardist and percussionist Chris Freeman, bassist Jonathan Corley and drummer Tim Very. Former drummer Jeremiah Edmond parted ways with the band in January 2010 to focus on his family as well as running the band's record label, Favorite Gentlemen. \n\nManchester Orchestra has released several extended plays and six studio albums: I'm Like A Virgin Losing A Child (2006), Mean Everything to Nothing (2009), Simple Math (2011), Cope (2014) (as well as its accompanying acoustic version, Hope), A Black Mile To The Surface (2017), and  The Million Masks of God (2021). They are signed to independent record label Favorite Gentlemen Recordings, which is distributed through Sony Music Entertainment, and Loma Vista Recordings. \n\nManchester Orchestra originated in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia. They are named after the English city Manchester, a place rich in musical history (The Smiths, The Stone Roses, Joy Division, Oasis, New Order, Happy Mondays). Feeling increasingly alienated at his \"small-town-Georgia, Christian high school\", Hull became so frustrated that he spent his senior year studying at home. Early in their career, the band recorded an album entitled Nobody Sings Anymore. However, it was never released due to the shift in the band's musical direction and personal changes undergone following its recording. The band stated that \"the band that made the record was different to the band now.\" Some of the tracks written for the album were released instead on the EP You Brainstorm, I Brainstorm, but Brilliance Needs a Good Editor.\n\nFollowing  You Brainstorm, I Brainstorm, but Brilliance Needs a Good Editor, Manchester Orchestra recorded and released their debut album I'm Like a Virgin Losing a Child. This album gained the attention of the music industry, and eventually led to their signing with Canvasback. The album was released nationwide July 27, 2007. Guitarist Robert McDowell did not appear on this album. The song Wolves At Night was featured in the video game NHL 08.\n\nIn October of 2008 the band recorded their second EP, Let My Pride Be What's Left Behind, with producer Dan Hannon and engineer Brad Fisher. It was released October 7, 2008.\n\nIn early September 2008, the band announced on their Myspace blog that they had begun recording their second album entitled Mean Everything to Nothing with producer Joe Chicarrelli (The Shins, My Morning Jacket). On February 4, 2009, the band posted a link to a free download of the single I've Got Friends and performed an acoustic version at The Fly’s In The Courtyard Sessions. The album was released April 21, 2009.\n\nOn January 26, 2010, the band released a digital split EP with Kevin Devine entitled I Could Be The Only One. Following the release of the Manchester Orchestra\/Kevin Devine split EP, it was announced that Kevin Devine would record a full-length album along with the members of Manchester Orchestra later that year, with half the album written by Devine and half by Andy Hull. On April 10, 2010, it was announced the new project's name was Bad Books, and that the album would be released under that moniker, and not \"Manchester Orchestra + Kevin Devine\" as previously speculated. The self-titled full-length Bad Books album was digitally released on October 19, 2010, and on CD on November 9, 2010.\n\nOn March 2010, in an interview with the Dallas Observer, Hull mentioned that the band had begun work on a follow up to 2009's Mean Everything to Nothing tentatively entitled Let Go of Your Sorrowful Groaning. He also said that the band have around 34 songs they are demoing and that in writing this album he was imagining a \"spiritual miscarriage\". Later that year in an interview with Rip It Up magazine, the band announced that they were in the middle of recording their third full-length album. Although without a title, they explained that the album was completely different to anything they had released in the past. The album was being recorded with Dan Hannon and balanced between Blackbird Studios (Nashville, TN) and their own Favorite Gentlemen Studios (Atlanta, GA).\n\nOn October 23, 2010, during an appearance at Radio 104.5 in Philadelphia, following a Bad Books show in support of their recently released self-titled debut album, Manchester Orchestra debuted an acoustic version of the title track of their new album, Simple Math. Originally scheduled for release in March 2011, the band announced in January of 2011 that their third full-length studio album, Simple Math, would be released on May 10, 2011, as well as announcing the album's tracklist and revealing that the album was set to be a concept album.\n\nFor more info, check out their official site: http:\/\/www.themanchesterorchestra.com\/ca\/home <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Manchester+Orchestra\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Spanish music group of celtic rock.\n\nIt was formed in Valladolid (Castilla y León) in 1986. Eight friends, four of which played in the group Almenara decided to participate in a music contest under the name \"Colectivo Eurofolk\". They won the first prize and continued to play together changing their name to Celtas Cortos.\n\nThey won another contest in April 1987, the prize was the production of an album. They shared the prize with two other winners, so they contributed three songs to the album Así es como suena: Folk joven.\n\nExecutive producer Paco Martín helped them get out their first album, Salida de emergencia, with only instrumental songs. The next album, Gente Impresentable added the voice and the lyrics of Jesús H. Cifuentes (Cifu) to the powerful instruments. Their celtic rock style was combined with protest and other more melancholic lyrics. Through the years their music mixed with different styles such as Caribbean music, flamenco, electronic music or reggae. Their list of hits include 20 de Abril, La senda del tiempo or Tranquilo Majete.\n\nIn 2002 Cifu left the group, a definitive turning point after the departure of César Cuenca and Nacho Martín. In the beginning of 2006 Cifu comes back to the group to prepare their next release, 20 years after their foundation. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Celtas+Cortos\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"In 2010, with more than 10 years of experience behind them, five musicians came together to form IZAL. A band made up of Mikel Izal (vocals, composer, guitar, ukulele), Emanuel Pérez “Gato” (bass), Alejandro Jordá (drums and percussion), Alberto Pérez (guitar, Lap Steel) and Iván Mella (piano, keyboards, synthesizers ). Coming from different geographical locations, Madrid became their \"base\" of operations, which is why the name \"Madrid band\" has been highly honored since its inception, despite not being originally from the capital. Vitoria and Pamplona, Málaga and Henderson (Argentina), Valencia, Calamonte in Extremadura and Bilbao come together in a band with multiple references that have managed to create their own musical and conceptual personality.\n\nStep by step, with 4 studio albums behind them (Magia y efectos especiales (2012), Agujeros de worm (2013), Copacabana (2015) and Autoterapia (2018), the band is positioned as the benchmark of the alternative scene and pop-rock from Spain, as the headliner at festivals as well as filling large arenas on their own tours, with the plus of having carried out a totally self-managed career from the beginning.\n\nIn autumn 2021, their fifth studio album, Hogar, was released independently, under the Hook Ediciones Musicales label and distributed by Altafonte. Hogar, an album of ten everyday stories told through photography, storytelling, video and song. Produced by IZAL, Brett Shaw (Foals, Florence and The Machine, Lady Gaga, etc.) and Sancho Gómez-Escolar, who dedicated the last months of 2020 to building ten new musical homes straddling the landscapes of the Tramontana mountains in Mallorca , the frenzy of the Madrid asphalt and the stubborn London rain. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Izal\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. Active for six decades, they are one of the most popular and enduring bands of the rock era. In the early 1960s, the Rolling Stones pioneered the gritty, rhythmically driven sound that came to define hard rock. Their first stable line-up consisted of vocalist Mick Jagger, multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, guitarist Keith Richards, bassist Bill Wyman, and drummer Charlie Watts. During their formative years, Jones was the primary leader: he assembled the band, named it, got them gigs, and drove their sound and image. After Andrew Loog Oldham became the group's manager in 1963, he encouraged them to write their own songs. Jagger and Richards became the primary creative force behind the band, alienating Jones, who had developed a drug addiction that interfered with his ability to contribute meaningfully.\n\nRooted in blues and early rock and roll, the Rolling Stones started out playing covers and were at the forefront of the British Invasion in 1964, becoming identified with the youthful and rebellious counterculture of the 1960s. They then found greater success with their own material, as \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" (1965), \"Get Off of My Cloud\" (1965), and \"Paint It Black\" (1966) became international number-one hits. Aftermath (1966) – their first entirely original album – is considered by The Daily Telegraph to be the most important of their formative records. In 1967, they had the double-sided hit \"Ruby Tuesday\"\/\"Let's Spend the Night Together\" and experimented with psychedelic rock on Their Satanic Majesties Request. They returned to their rhythm and blues roots with hit songs such as \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" (1968) and \"Honky Tonk Women\" (1969), and albums such as Beggars Banquet (1968), featuring \"Sympathy for the Devil\", and Let It Bleed (1969), featuring \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" and \"Gimme Shelter\". Let It Bleed was the first of five consecutive number-one albums in the UK.\n\nJones left the band shortly before his death in 1969, having been replaced by guitarist Mick Taylor. That year they were first introduced on stage as \"The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World\". Sticky Fingers (1971), which yielded \"Brown Sugar\" and included the first usage of their tongue and lips logo, was their first of eight consecutive number-one studio albums in the US. Exile on Main St. (1972), featuring \"Tumbling Dice\", and Goats Head Soup (1973), yielding the hit ballad \"Angie\", were also best sellers. Taylor was replaced by Ron Wood in 1974. The band continued to release successful albums, including their two largest sellers: Some Girls (1978), featuring \"Miss You\", and Tattoo You (1981), featuring \"Start Me Up\". Steel Wheels (1989) was widely considered a comeback album and was followed by Voodoo Lounge (1994), a worldwide number-one album. Both releases were promoted by large stadium and arena tours, as the Stones continued to be a huge concert attraction; by 2007 they had recorded the all-time highest-grossing concert tour three times, and as recently as 2021 they were the highest-earning live act of the year. From Wyman's departure in 1993 to Watts' death in 2021, the band continued as a four-piece core, with Darryl Jones playing bass on tour and on most studio recordings, while Steve Jordan became their touring drummer following Watts' death. Their 2016 album, Blue & Lonesome, became their twelfth UK number-one album.\n\nThe Rolling Stones' estimated record sales of 200 million make them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The band has won three Grammy Awards and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. Billboard magazine and Rolling Stone have ranked the band as one of the greatest of all time.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Rolling_Stones\n\nStudio albums\nThe Rolling Stones \/ England's Newest Hit Makers (1964)\n12 X 5 (1964)\nThe Rolling Stones No. 2 \/ The Rolling Stones, Now!

It reached no. 1 on iTunes and Billboard Reggae charts, and has songs as 'Breathe' and 'Weight Of Sound (feat. TJ O'Neill) '. The band then toured in USA with other reggae groups. (Rebelution, The Green, Passafire, Tribal Seeds, The Expendables). The 6th album, Set In Stone (2015) included collaborations with Collie Buddz (the song 'Smokin’ Love (ft. Collie Buddz)'). Also with Eric Rachmany and Slightly Stoopid. Again they topped Billboard Reggae Albums Chart.\n_   _   _\n\nPossessing a unique style of music that combines a creative blend of upbeat roots reggae with the reverberating echoes of dub, comes a man with no limit for his musical abilities. Stick Figure's music is written, recorded, and produced by Scott Woodruff, a young man from Duxbury, MA.\n\nAll of Stick Figure's songs are made by recording each instrument separately, layering several tracks on top of one another in unison.\n\nStick Figure recently relocated to Southern California and has picked up three new members for the live band, Brendan Dane (San Diego) on bass, Todd Smith (San Clemente) on drums and Kevin Bong (San Diego) on keys. All are incredible musicians and are surely a great addition to the Stick Figure sound. The band is currently in the process of recording their first debut album together, expecting to drop this Winter.\n\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Stick+Figure\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"While it’s a rare commodity for a band to tour as consistently as Slightly Stoopid, the group’s diligent commitment to live music provides some insight into their loyal fan base and unique creative metamorphosis throughout their extensive existence. Though it's been a couple of years since the release of their last studio album, Top Of The World (August 14, 2012), the Ocean Beach, California-based group—led by co-founders and multi-instrumentalists Kyle McDonald and Miles Doughty—have also found the same passionate dedication to their studio craft, holing up between tours in their own San Diego recording studio and record label complex. The balance of a prolific touring regimen between albums have helped to refine the tasty fusion and massive groove that permeates Stoopid’s trademark sound and seven album catalogue, as well as their live shows.\n\n\"We're a touring act, and we've been on the road pretty much non-stop over the last decade,\" explains Doughty, offering that the more recent creation of the band's own local recording studio and rehearsal clubhouse (within the warehouse district of Mission Valley just inland of Ocean Beach) certainly aided and influenced their last release Top of the World, and has inspired their latest sessions, which the band anticipates could stretch into a few different recording projects.\n\n\"Over the last 3 years we started our own studio and within the last 9 months, anticipating the window for new album sessions, the band has invested into innovations and equipment upgrades for the studio in a quest to capture and progress our signature sound forward. Having our own studio really enables us to make records at our own pace and to make the right records, hopefully (with a grin) at various stages of our career,” Doughty continues. “What's nice about having our own environment to record in and analyze the music is it really lets you keep an organic feel. For us, I feel like it's a step into the next level, as far as understanding the process of recording, understanding the process of songwriting. We took everything that we've learned over the years and really put it into this place and into our music.” The property also houses the creative loft space that has become the official offices of the band’s own label Stoopid Records, which issued the band’s second album in 1999 Acoustic Roots, and has continued to be their preferred method of distributing the band’s recorded material.\n\nAnother key ingredient to what makes Slightly Stoopid extraordinarily special is the inclusion of several musical guests, both live and in the studio. \"It really keeps that 'family atmosphere' for us,” says Doughty. “I think it really shows in the music — we live for the spirit of collaboration and on Top of The World we had G. Love, Angelo Moore from Fishbone, Don Carlos, Barrington Levy, Ian Neville from Dumpstaphunk, Tory Ruffin from Morris Day and the Time and Fishbone, and singer\/songwriter Angela Hunte. Angelo Moore to me is one of the greatest front-men to ever step foot on a stage. As a fan and out of respect, I try to do something with Angelo every time we have a record, really. If you listen to his lyrics, his vocal performance—I don't know who could keep up with Angelo on stage. Don Carlos from Black Uhuru is one of the legendary reggae singers of all time and we've had the pleasure of working with him the last few years. We've been friends with G. Love for over 15 years, and we've been able to work together quite a few different times in the studio. It seems like second nature. Whenever you're recording with G., it's almost like you're really just hanging out with your bro and you happen to hit record. We've done so many shows together and so many studio sessions, it becomes second nature.“ <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Slightly+Stoopid\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"The Black Keys are an alternative rock  group from Akron, Ohio, United States which formed in 2001, consisting of singer and guitarist Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney. The band name was inspired by a schizophrenic artist and friend in Akron, who used the term \"black keys\" to describe things he disliked or people he did not trust. The Black Keys have roots in traditional blues and psychedelic rock stylings.\n\nThey released their first album, The Big Come Up, in 2002, followed by Thickfreakness in 2003, and Rubber Factory in 2004. October 2005 saw the release of the DVD Live, recorded live at The Metro Theatre in Sydney, Australia March 18, 2005. In 2006 they released Magic Potion, as well as the lesser-known Chulahoma and a single version of Your Touch.\n\nOne of their trademarks is their preference for simple, lo-fi recording techniques. They refuse to use big-name studios, and do most recording, producing, and mixing themselves. Most of Thickfreakness was recorded in about 14 hours in Carney's basement, using only an early 80's Tascam 388 8-track recorder. Often, their recordings still have background noises (such as an owl hooting).\n\nThe Black Keys have achieved increasing critical acclaim and recognition since their debut album, which itself received praise from Rolling Stone magazine. Time magazine named them one of the \"10 Best Acts of 2003\" (behind OutKast and The White Stripes). They have supported a number of bands: they toured with Sleater-Kinney in 2003, had a short stint opening for Beck, have recently opened for Radiohead on the American leg of their brief 2006 tour, and performed at Lollapalooza in 2005 and 2007. In addition to this, they were also well-liked by influential British radio DJ John Peel and appeared on both Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Late Show with David Letterman. Famous followers of the band include Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant, Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead, and Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammet. Matt Helders, drummer for the Arctic Monkeys, can be seen in a Black Keys T-Shirt in an interview on MTV's RAW. \n\nTheir song \"When the Lights Go Out\" was featured in the 2007 film Black Snake Moan, and also on the soundtrack for that movie. The Black Keys were included in the soundtrack of the 2003 movie School of Rock with their song, \"Set You Free\". \"Lies\" was featured in the conclusion of the February 4, 2009 episode of Lie to Me. One of their songs, \"Girl Is on My Mind\", was used in a 2006 Sony Ericsson advertisement, starring the tennis players Ana Ivanović and Daniela Hantuchová, gaining the band more commercial recognition. It was also used in a 2006 Victoria's Secret commercial featuring Heidi Klum and could be heard in the movies Rest Stop and Cashback. Their song \"10 am Automatic\" was used in the video game MLB '06: The Show, The O.C., The Go-Getter, and was also used in a 2007 American Express commercial starring Shaun White. \"Your Touch\" was featured in a 2007 Lee's jeans commercial, and can be heard both in an episode of NBC's Friday Night Lights and in an episode of \"Eastbound and Down\". Their cover \"Grown So Ugly\" can be heard in the background of the going away party in the 2007 film Cloverfield. \"Strange Times\" is used in Grand Theft Auto IV on the in-game radio station Radio Broker. \"Strange Times\" can also be heard during a preview for ABC's The Mole, and the trailer for season three of the Showtime series Dexter, as well as a promo for Gossip Girl. Their song \"Just Got To Be\" is used on the soundtrack for the video game NHL 08, and \"Hard Row\" is featured in the premiere episode of the FX show Sons of Anarchy. Sons of Anarchy has gone on to use \"Keep Me\" in both Episodes 6 and 7, as well as \"Busted\" in episode 7. The song \"Lies\" is featured in the advertising campaign for the third season of HBO's Big Love. \"The Breaks\" can be heard in Guy Ritchie' film RocknRolla. \"Your Touch\" can also be heard in the HBO series \"Entourage\" in the episode \"Manic Monday\", during the opening scenes. The song \"Psychotic Girl\" is featured the episode \"Messin' with the Kid\" in season 6 of One Tree Hill. \"I'll Be Your Man\" is the opening theme song for the HBO show Hungand was also featured in an episode of the FX Network show Rescue Me. \"Your Touch\" can also be heard in the film Zombieland and in an episode of \"Eastbound and Down\" on HBO. The song \"I Got Mine\" has been used in HBO's sports reality series 24\/7 Pacquiao-Hatton\" [13] as well as background music for the 2009 American League Championship Series. The song \"Next Girl\" is featured in the in game radio of Saints Row the Third.\n\nTheir fourth record that Danger Mouse produced Attack & Release  was out April 1st 2008. The duo's fifth album is the first one recorded in a proper studio.\n\nThe Band's fifth album, \"Brothers\" was released in spring 2010 and has seen increasing amounts of exposure to the \"Dancing T-Rex\" video for the song \"Tighten Up\" that went viral...until the band asked it to be removed because they felt it made light of their music. A proper video was released later in 2010, featuring Dan Auerbach and Pat Carney at a playground and was pushed on the band's official YouTube channel, as well as through the iTunes and Zune marketplaces.  The track \"Tighten Up\" was also used as the background music for a Subaru Legacy commercial and on the FIFA 2011 Soundtrack.\n\nThe Black Keys' seventh studio album, \"El Camino,\" was released on the 6th of December 2011. Co-produced by Danger Mouse, the album was released to critical acclaim, receiving positive reviews from The Rolling Stones, NME and more. Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly commented on \"El Camino\", saying that \"El Camino trades the soulful stylings of Brothers for harder-driving, faster-riffing rock & roll\". At the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, El Camino won the award for Best Rock Album, while \"Lonely Boy\" received multiple honors, taking 'Best Rock Performance' and 'Best Rock Song'. The album has sold 1.4 million copies in the United States to date.\n\nThe Black Keys' eighth studio album, Turn Blue, was released on May 12, 2014 to generally favorable reviews. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Black+Keys\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Skillet is an American Christian rock band formed in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1996 by vocalist John Cooper and guitarist Ken Steorts.\n\nThe current lineup consists of: John Cooper (lead vocals, bass and acoustic guitar), Korey Cooper (keyboards, synthesizer, rythm guitar and backing vocals), Jen Ledger (drums and backing vocals) and Seth Morrison (lead guitar).\n\nHistory\nFoundation and first years\nSkillet formed in 1996 with two members: John Cooper, former vocalist for Tennessee progressive rock band Seraph, and Ken Steorts, former guitarist for Urgent Cry. The two bands met through touring together, but those bands disbanded soon after, so John and Ken's pastor encouraged them to form their own band as a side-project. Coming from different styles of rock music, they decided to name the experiment Skillet. After Trey McClurkin joined the band as a permanent drummer. Skillet was only together for a month when they received interest from major Christian record label ForeFront Records. In 1996 they released a self-titled debut Skillet. It was well-received, and the trio continued to write new material as they toured the United States. One topic that comes up often among fans and the band itself, is the name 'Skillet'. John Cooper, the lead vocalist, explains that it was a joke at first. Each starting band member was already in a separate band, and all decided to start a side project. Since each other band had a different sound and style to it, the side project was said to be like putting all of those styles in a big skillet to come up with something unique. Hence the band name 'Skillet'. The band name is still somewhat of a joke between the band members, especially Cooper, who claims to still not like the title.\n\nSkillet recorded their follow-up album throughout 1997, titled Hey You, I Love Your Soul, which was released in April 1998. Their second effort was a change in style from the band's first release. With this release, Skillet would abandon their post-grunge approach for a lighter alternative rock. His wife Korey was enlisted soon after to play keyboards live in order to alleviate John's live performance duties.\n\nInvincible, Ardent Worship, and Alien Youth (2000–02)\nShortly before the band began recording for their third album, Invincible, Steorts left the band to be with his family, and Kevin Haaland joined the band as their new guitarist. Korey Cooper joined the band permanently and played keyboards for the recording of Invincible. Because of this change, the musical style on Invincible changed to a more electronic sound. Soon after the release of Invincible in early 2000, Trey McClurkin parted ways with Skillet, and Lori Peters filled the drummer's position. Invincible would be Skillet's best selling record to date.\n\nThe band released their first worship album, and fourth album overall, Ardent Worship in Fall 2000. The band kept much of their sound from Invincible on their next album Alien Youth. With little time between touring and recording, Skillet released Alien Youth on August 28, 2001, which was the first album that John Cooper took on production duties. Before the release of Alien Youth, Haaland left the band, and Ben Kasica took over on guitar. The first single, the title track, was a major hit in the Christian market and drove Skillet into their first headlining shows.\n\nCollide (2003–05)\nIn 2003, Collide was released by Ardent Records. It caught the attention of Andy Karp, the Head of A&R of Lava Records, and in 2004 the rights to Collide were bought by Lava Records, a division of Atlantic Records. On May 25, 2004, the album was re-released under Lava Records, with an added track, Open Wounds. Collide was yet another musical shift for the band. Citing Linkin Park and P.O.D. as inspiration for the musical shift on Collide, Cooper said, \"Well I’m one of these song writers, everything I hear goes through my John Cooper filter of what I like and what I don’t like. [...] All these things [...] have been an influence on me.'\n\nComatose (2006–08)\nSkillet's album Comatose was released on October 3, 2006. It features the singles Rebirthing, Whispers in the Dark, Comatose, The Older I Get, Those Nights and The Last Night. The album debuted at #55 on the Billboard 200 and #4 on the US Top Christian Albums chart. In January 2008, Skillet announced that their drummer, Lori Peters, was retiring from the band, feeling that \"it's time for her to come off of the road and start a new chapter in her life.\" Peters' last concert with Skillet was on December 31, 2007. However, during the 2007 Christmas season, she took the time to train Skillet's next drummer, Jen Ledger.\nOn October 21, 2008, Comatose Comes Alive was released; a CD\/DVD combo featuring live recordings of the band's May 9, 2008 concert in Chattanooga, Tennessee. It was shown on the Gospel Music Channel on December 5, 2008 and it also had a B-side with Live Free or Let Me Die as a single, also with five acoustic tracks which purchasers could download by putting the Comatose Comes Alive CD in their computer. The Comatose album was certified Gold in sales by the RIAA on November 3, 2009.\n\nAwake (2009–2011)\nSkillet announced that they went into the studio January 12 to finalize the new record with Grammy-nominated producer Howard Benson. They added two songs (Hero and Monster) from the new record to their setlist on April 2, 2009 in Evansville, Indiana as part of their Comatose Tour 2009.\n\nAwake was released with twelve songs on August 25, 2009. It charted at #2 on the Billboard top 200 selling around 68,000 units in its first week. Monster was released as a single on July 14, 2009. Contrary to popular belief, John Cooper stated that Hero was not the album's lead single. It was, however, released as a single in March 2010.They also released a deluxe version with the extra songs \"Dead Inside\" and \"Would It Matter\", along with the original, radio edit of \"Monster\" that does not have the distorted growl as in the single and in the CD. The song \"Hero\" was used in the publicizing of the first football game of the 2009 NFL season between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Tennessee Titans, and the song \"Monster\" was used in the episode \"Jason: The Pretty-Boy Bully\" on MTV's Bully Beatdown. \"Monster\" was the theme song for the WWE event WWE  Hell  in a Cell while the song \"Hero\" was the theme song for WWE Tribute to the Troops and Royal Rumble 2010, as well as both songs being included on the official soundtrack for the WWE video game WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010. It is also the opening theme song for the AHL team the Lake Erie Monsters in Cleveland, Ohio and serves as the opening theme of the Fresno Monsters of Fresno, California. \"Monster\" was aired at the beginning of several ACC football games on Raycom Sports during the 2009 season. In the first week of April 2010, it was released for the Rock band music store in Rock Band 2 It also tied the record for highest-charting Christian album on the Billboard 200 with Underoath's 2006 release Define the Great Line and Casting Crowns' 2007 release The Altar and the Door, as all three albums debuted at #2.\n\nOn February 18, Skillet was nominated for 6 Dove Awards for the 41st Annual GMA Dove Awards.Awake was certified gold July 2, 2010. A remix on Monster was featured on their podcast Also in 2010, Ardent released The Early Years, a collection of their songs from 1996 to 2001. On November 12, Skillet released an iTunes sessions EP consisting of songs from Comatose and Awake. \"Monster\" was certified gold a day later. \n\nRise (2011)\nOn June 21, 2011 John posted to his Twitter account that the band rehearsed new music for the first time and that they are getting ready for a new album.  At a question and answer session before a concert, John Cooper said that they would be recording a new record in January\/February 2012. However, the band was then scheduled to headline the WinterJam Tour. In January 2012, Skillet announced that they will not be touring for most of the summer so that they can record the new album. They plan to enter the studio at the conclusion of the Winter Jam eastern tour, approximately in May, for a release in late 2012.\n\nDuring a July 18, 2012 interview with RadioU, John Cooper stated the band currently had 61 songs written and would be heading into the studio in October to record the album with Howard Benson for an early 2013 release.\n\nIn an interview with CCM Magazine, John Cooper described the new album as \"a roller coaster ride\". He states: \"We have aggressive tracks, artsy and musical tracks, which is new territory for Skillet. A couple songs are classic American heartland anthems, and a couple songs are signature symphonic-classical rock Skillet. Guitars are dirty and edgier, with absolute shredding solos by Seth.\" One of the songs mentioned in the interview was titled \"Salvation\".\n\nIn an Interview on January 26, 2013 In Beaumont TX, John Cooper announced that the new album, Rise, would be coming out in May 2013, but was later scheduled for a June 25, 2013 release. In an interview with NoiseCreep, John Cooper stated the first single and music video is scheduled to be released by late April. The first single from the album, \"Sick of It\", will be released to US Rock radio on April 23, 2013. It was later confirmed that the first single, \"Sick of It\", would be released on April 9, 2013.  \"Rise\" proved to be another commercial success, generating hit singles like \"Not Gonna Die\" and \"Sick of It.\"  The latter song won the GMA Dove Award for Rock Song of the Year in 2014.\n\nThe band continued to add to their discography with the release of \"Unleashed\" in 2016.  In 2019, their studio album \"Victorious\" reached the top spot on the Billboard Top Christian Albums chart.  This album's success extended to awards, winning the GMA Dove Award for Rock\/Contemporary Album of the Year in 2020.  The song \"Legendary\" from \"Victorious\" also received recognition, winning the GMA Dove Award for Rock\/Contemporary Recorded Song of the Year in 2020.\n\nSkillet showed no signs of slowing down.  In September 2021, they released the single \"Surviving the Game,\" a precursor to their eleventh studio album, \"Dominion,\" which arrived in January 2022.  Their creative flow continued in December 2022 with the release of a deluxe edition of \"Dominion\" titled \"Dominion: Day of Destiny,\" featuring the new single \"Psycho In My Head.\"\n\nSkillet haven't just been focused on recording new music.  They've also maintained an active touring schedule throughout this period.  This dedication to live performances even saw them headline the Winter Jam Tour in 2018 for the third time, making it their fourth appearance to date.  In 2018, drummer Jen Ledger embarked on a solo career alongside her work with the band.\n\nTouring:\n\nSkillet performing live on April 12, 2008 at Anderson University, Anderson, Indiana.\nIn the middle of 2006, Korey Cooper took a break from performing, due to her pregnancy with their second child.

Later drummer Malcolm Holmes and saxophonist Martin Cooper joined. McCluskey and Humphreys formed the core of the outfit until 1989, when the group split in two.

        "biografia":"Tool is an American alternative metal\/progressive metal band from Los Angeles. Formed in 1990, the group's line-up includes vocalist Maynard James Keenan, guitarist Adam Jones and drummer Danny Carey. Justin Chancellor has been the band's bassist since 1995, replacing their original bassist Paul D'Amour. Tool has won four Grammy Awards, performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping the charts in several countries.\n\nTo date, the band has released five studio albums, one EP and one box set. They emerged with a heavy metal sound on their first studio album, Undertow (1993), and became a dominant act in the alternative metal movement with the release of their follow-up album Ænima in 1996. Their efforts to unify musical experimentation, visual arts, and a message of personal evolution continued with Lateralus (2001) and 10,000 Days (2006), gaining critical acclaim and international commercial success. Their fifth studio album, Fear Inoculum, was released on August 30, 2019, to widespread critical acclaim. Prior to its release, the band had sold more than 13 million albums in the US alone.\n\nDue to Tool's incorporation of visual arts and very long and complex releases, the band is generally described as a style-transcending act and part of progressive rock, psychedelic rock, and art rock. The relationship between the band and today's music industry is ambivalent, at times marked by censorship, and the band's insistence on privacy.\n\nThere is a raging debate about whether Tool can be considered \"post-metal\" or not. However, they surely had a hand in its creation as much as Neurosis. The influential act Isis was heavily influenced by Tool's music, so much that they lifted entire basslines and guitar riffing from Tool and even their iconic snare sound was inspired by Tool's style. Much has been made of both Isis and Tool's sound and influence across the years but one thing is for sure: modern post-metal has their fingerprints everywhere and it would not have sounded the way that it currently sounds without them. Additionally, Tool was actually aware of and liked Isis' music as they chose Isis as touring partners, a move that brought even more attention to Isis' music.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tool_(band)\n\nStudio albums\nUndertow (1993)\nÆnima (1996)\nLateralus (2001)\n10,000 Days (2006)\nFear Inoculum (2019)\n\nOther releases\n[Demo tape] 72826 (1991)\n[EP]Opiate (1992)\n[Live album]Salival (2000)\n[Non-album single]Opiate² (2022) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Tool\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Fitz and the Tantrums are an American soul group from Los Angeles, California. The group was founded in 2008 by Michael Fitzpatrick, who had begun writing soul music for a solo project on an old church organ he had purchased. He added friend James King to the group as an arranger and soon after expanded the band to a seven-piece, including several horns. Fitzpatrick shares the vocal duties with Noelle Scaggs. Other members include Joseph Karnes, Jeremy Ruzumna, and John Wicks.\n\nThe group's debut EP, Songs for a Breakup, Vol. 1, was released in 2009. Dangerbird Records signed the group in 2010 and issued their first full-length album, Pickin' Up the Pieces, in August of that year. The album reached #15 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. Los Angeles Times music critic Ann Powers wrote, \"Fitz & the Tantrums is the kind of band that communicates best in concert, but this album serves as a fine proxy and party-starter.\" Aly Comingore of the Santa Barbara Independent wrote that the band members craft \"soulful, nostalgia pop that's not only infectious, but just fresh enough to make it stand apart from its predecessors.\"\n\nIn 2010 the group opened several dates on tour with Maroon 5. On January 12, 2011, Fitz & the Tantrums performed the songs \"MoneyGrabber\" and \"Don't Gotta Work It Out\" on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live in Los Angeles. In 2010 the groups music video for the song \"MoneyGrabber\" was incorporated into the opening scene of a sixth season episode of the CBS crime-drama Criminal Minds entitled \"Safe Haven\".\n\nFitzpatrick has said that the band's musical style can be fairly described as \"soul-influenced pop\". He noted that while the band is influenced by the classic songs of the Motown and Stax record labels, the band is not trying to create an exact replica of that music. In another interview, Fitzpatrick talked about his decision to not use guitars in the band. \"I did want to try and make a big sounding record without guitars,\" he said. \"For me, I just feel like in any music that has a band, the guitar is always there, it's always featured, it's always prevalent. I'm just sick of hearing it.\" <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Fitz+and+the+Tantrums\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Gallagher is regarded as one of the most recognisable figures in British rock music and is known for his distinctive vocal style and outspoken manner.\n\nGallagher joined a band initially known as the Rain. Following mutual agreement among its members, the band was renamed Oasis. His older brother, Noel Gallagher, was first approached to manage the group but later joined as lead guitarist. Oasis released their debut album, \"Definitely Maybe\", in 1994 to critical and commercial success amid the rise of Britpop. Their second album, \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\", released in 1995, achieved international chart success, while their third album, \"Be Here Now\" (1997), became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history. Although Britpop declined in popularity towards the end of the 1990s, Oasis continued to release commercially successful albums, all of which topped the UK Albums Chart. The band performed to large audiences worldwide, particularly in Europe and South America. In August 2009, following Noel Gallagher’s departure from Oasis, Liam Gallagher and the remaining members formed Beady Eye, releasing two studio albums before disbanding in 2014.\n\nGallagher began his solo career in 2017 with the release of his debut album \"As You Were\", which was both a critical and commercial success. It reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and became the ninth fastest-selling debut album of the 2010s in the UK, with over 103,000 units sold in its first week. The album was later certified platinum in the UK. His second solo album, \"Why Me? Why Not\", released in 2019, also reached number one and became the fastest-selling vinyl record of that year. This marked Gallagher’s tenth number one album, including his work with Oasis. His third solo album, \"C’mon You Know\", released in 2022, also debuted at number one in the UK. In 2024, Gallagher collaborated with former Stone Roses guitarist John Squire on the studio album \"Liam Gallagher & John Squire\", released on 1 March 2024.\n\nGallagher's career with Oasis was marked by public disputes with his brother Noel and frequent media coverage of their personal behaviour. The band’s rivalry with fellow Britpop group Blur also received significant attention during the 1990s. In 2010, Gallagher was voted the greatest frontman of all time in a Q magazine reader poll. In 2019, he was awarded the MTV Europe Music Award for Rock Icon.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Liam_Gallagher\n\nStudio albums\nAs You Were (2017)\nWhy Me? Why Not.

        "biografia":"Progressive rock band from Buenos Aires, Argentina formed in 1977 by Charly García, guitarist David Lebón, bassist Pedro Aznar, and drummer Oscar Moro. Widely regarded as the most talented group of rock musicians Argentina produced in the late 70's and early 80's, to the point they were dubbed \"The Argentinean Beatles\" by fans and critics alike.\n\nAfter leaving La Máquina De Hacer Pájaros, García moved to Brazil to start his new project. In 1978, \"Serú Girán\" was released after recording sessions in São Paulo and Los Angeles, U.S., having Daniel Goldberg in charge of its orchestral arrangements. \n\nThat album was presented first to music journalists and later at Buenos Aires' Luna Park. The press was pleased, but music fans weren't prepared for the experimental style played by the band. \n\nThat mixed response drove Serú Girán to release a less complicated album in 1979 called \"La Grasa De Las Capitales\", presented live at the Buenos Aires' Auditorium. \"Bicicleta\" came in 1980, followed by a show at the Monterrey Jazz Festival in Rio de Janeiro. \n\n\"Peperina\" was released in 1981. The band decided to break up after two shows at Obras Sanitarias in March 1982. \n\nSerú Girán came back with \"Serú\" in 1992 and later with\"Yo No Quiero Volverme Tan Loco\" in the year 2000.\n\nOscar Moro died in Buenos Aires on July 11th, 2006. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/+noredirect\/Ser%C3%BA+Gir%C3%A1n\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"ONE OK ROCK (ワンオクロック, \"ok\" pronounced as a word) is a Japanese alternative rock\/pop punk band from Tokyo formed in 2005. They play varied styles of music, with songs ranging from alternative rock and emo to post-hardcore and pop punk.\n\nMembers:\n* Vocals: Taka (森内 寛貴, Moriuchi Takahiro, born April 17, 1988 in Tokyo)\n* Guitar, backing vocals: Toru (山下 亨, Yamashita Tōru, born December 7, 1988 in Osaka)\n* Bass: Ryota (小浜 良太, Kohama Ryōta, born September 4, 1989 in Osaka) \n* Drums: Tomoya (神吉 智也, Kanki Tomoya, born June 27, 1987 in Hyogo)\n\nFormer members:\n* Lead guitar, backing vocals: Alexander Reimon \"Alex\" Onizawa (鬼澤 アレクサンダー 礼門, Onizawa Alexander Reimon, 2005–2009\n* Drums, percussion: Yu Koyanagi (小柳 友, Koyanagi Yū), 2005–2006\n\nThe band was originally affiliated with Amuse since their debut in 2007. The band left Amuse on April 1, 2021, and established their own management agency, named 10969 Inc. They are signed with the Fueled by Ramen record label in the United States.\n\nThe band rose to international fame with their 2012 single \"The Beginning\" from their sixth album Jinsei×Boku=, which led them to concerts and music festivals outside of Asia. Following this success, One Ok Rock began releasing dual versions (Japanese-English and full English) of subsequent albums, with two to three different tracks on each version. Their seventh studio album, 35xxxv, became the band's first to enter Billboard music charts in the US, peaking at No. 11 on Heatseekers Albums, No. 43 on Independent Albums, No. 23 on Hard Rock Albums, and No. 1 on the World Albums chart. The band's eighth album, Ambitions, which incorporated more arena rock and pop-rock, debuted at No. 106 on the Billboard 200 and entered several international charts as well. The band adopted a more electronic and pop sound on their ninth album Eye of the Storm (2019). They experimented with a more rock-centered sound while still incorporating modern pop-rock for their 2022 album, Luxury Disease.\n\nOne Ok Rock won Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards for Eastern Breakthrough Male Band in 2016, and Rock Sound Awards for Best International Band in 2017 and Best Live Performance in 2018. The band was also nominated for two Alternative Press Music Awards – Best International Band in 2016 and Best Breakthrough Band in 2017.\n\nHistory:\n\n2005–2006: Formation and early releases\nThe history of One Ok Rock began on July 29, 2005, when Toru Yamashita, a high school student, wanted to start a band. He invited his childhood friend Ryota Kohama, who was also a member of the hip-hop dance group HEADS they were both in years prior. He told Ryota to learn the bass and asked Alexander Onizawa, who was their senior in school, to join to be their guitarist and his classmate, Yu Koyanagi, to play drums. While searching for a vocalist, Toru found Takahiro Moriuchi, who was in a cover band called Chivalry of Music. Impressed by Taka's singing skills, Toru insisted he join One Ok Rock instead. At first, Taka refused, despite repeated attempts to sway him, but eventually, he joined the band. The band's name was suggested by Koyanagi and comes from \"one o'clock\", the time that the band used to practice their music on weekends. They chose to play at one o'clock in the morning because it was cheaper to use the rehearsal space during such hours. However, noticing that the Japanese language made no distinction between R's and L's, \"O'CLOCK\" transformed into \"O'CROCK\" or \"O'KROCK\", which later transformed into \"OK ROCK\". In addition, One Ok Rock can be expressed as \"10969\" (wan-ō-ku-ro-ku). It is also the name of their management agency they set up in 2021.\n\nThe band released their self-produced demo CD \"Do You Know A Christmas?\" on December 21, 2005. In 2006, they released 2 EPs, \"ONE OK ROCK\" and \"KEEP IT REAL\".\n\nAfter signing with Amuse, Inc., Yu Koyanagi left the band to pursue an acting career and was replaced by Tomoya Kanki who was a student at the ESP Musical Academy and was already in a band that was not going well. He then joined One Ok Rock in 2006 and became an official member when they debuted in 2007.\n\n2007–2009: Debut album, Beam of Light, Kanjo Effect and departure of Alex\nIn 2007, the band released their debut single, \"Naihishinsho\", reached number 48 on the Oricon Charts and sold 15,000 copies. Their second and third single, \"Yume Yume\" and \"Et Cetera\", replicated that success and charted at number 43 and 29, respectively. After those singles, they released their debut album Zeitakubyō on November 21, 2007, and had their first tour, the Tokyo-Osaka-Nagoya Quattro Tour.\n\nThey released their second album Beam of Light in May 2008. In an interview with Rockin'On Japan magazine in June 2012, the band said they did not count this album as an album, but rather as a part of growing up as a band. When they made the album, they had not been in the right mood, but felt that they had to make it to grow as a band. The band came up with many sound sources and ended up making a punk album. The album's confused origins were the reason why they would not play any songs from Beam of Light in live performances. Shortly after releasing Beam of Light, later they performed a gig at Shibuya AX.\n\nThey had planned to release two albums in that one year, so they released Kanjou Effect in November 2008. At this point the band had gained more experience and were able to do some more serious recording. They settled into the Western sound they were influenced by. They replaced all their engineers and introduced their music to new producers.\n\nOn April 5, 2009, Alex was arrested for groping the leg of a twenty-one-year-old female student on a train. He admitted to the charges and the case was settled out of court. The band reached their weakest point at this time. Ryota intended to leave bass and take up guitar. They felt it was impossible for them to add a new member. The band's next single, \"Around the World Shounen\", which was planned for a May 6 release as the theme song for the TV drama GodHand Teru, and their nationwide tour were both cancelled. In May 2009, it was announced that One Ok Rock would continue on as a 4-piece band without Alex, who went back to the United States. Toru took his place as lead guitar, and the band re-arranged their songs to be played for one guitar.\n\n2010–2012: Niche Syndrome, music festivals, and Zankyo Reference\nWith the new four-member formation, One Ok Rock released the single \"Kanzen Kankaku Dreamer\" on February 3, 2010. The song peaked at number nine on the Oricon Singles Chart in Japan. After four months, the band released their fourth studio album titled Niche Syndrome. Released on June 9, 2010, the album peaked at number three on the Billboard's Top Albums Sales chart. For the promotion of Niche Syndrome, One Ok Rock embarked on the \"This is my own judgement!\" tour initially in five Zepp music halls across the nation in 6 days, starting Sendai, Osaka, Nagoya, Fukuoka and ending in a 2-day concert in Tokyo. The second part the tour took place at sixteen different venues until December 11, 2010. They held a final performance in Nippon Budokan, Tokyo on November 28, followed by the release of a concert DVD This is My Budokan?! on February 16, 2011. On August 6, 7 and 8, One Ok Rock headlined Rock in Japan Festival and Summer Sonic Festival, followed by Rising Sun Rock Festival, Monster Bash, Treasure05X, Mad Ollie, Countdown Japan 2010\/2011, and Radio Crazy. The band supported Pay Money to My Pain in their 2010 Stay Real tour, The Hiatus in their Anomaly 2010 tour, and Totalfat in their Overdrive tour.\n\nOn February 16, 2011, the band released the single \"Answer is Near\", later, from April to June of the same year, they performed the \"Answer is Alive 2011 tour\". After that, One Ok Rock released their first double A-side single \"Re:make\/No Scared\" on July 20, 2011. \"No Scared\" was the main theme for the Black Rock Shooter: The Game video game. The band's fifth album, Zankyo Reference, was released on October 5, 2011. One Ok Rock announced fourteen dates between November and December 2011 for the Zankyo Reference Tour. The band also announced their final performance for this album as a two-day concert in Yokohama Arena on January 21 and 22, 2012. This was their first time playing in Yokohama Arena, the biggest venue in the Kantō region. The concert was sold out with more than 24,000 attendees. Later, the documentary of the Zankyo Reference Tour and the performance from the second night in Yokohama Arena was released on Blu-ray and DVD on May 30, 2012.\n\nDuring 2011, One Ok Rock headlined many music festivals, including Jisan Valley Rock Festival in South Korea. In July the band performed at Setstock 2011, followed by Rock in Japan Festival, Rising Sun Rock Festival, Summer Sonic Festival, Monster Bash, Sky Jamboree, and Space Shower's Sweet Love Shower. At the end of the year, they headlined Radio Crazy and Countdown Japan once more.\n\nThe band declared their first overseas tour in Start Walking The World on May and June 2012, covering Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore. They headlined Rock in Japan Festival on the main stage, as well as Summer Sonic 2012, and additionally, Oga Namahage Rock Festival, Rising Sun Rock Festival, and Sweet Love Shower.

Later, \"The Beginning\" won two awards: Best Rock Video from the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards Japan and a second award as Best Your Choice in Space Shower Music Video Awards.\n\n2013–2014: Jinsei×Boku=, Fool Cool Rock, and Worldwide Tour\nOn January 9, 2013, One Ok Rock released the double single \"Deeper Deeper\/Nothing Helps\", and hit 2nd place on the Oricon charts.

Their sixth full-length album Jinsei×Boku= was released on March 6, 2013, and managed to reach second place on the Oricon weekly chart. In October 2013 the band went on their first tour outside Asia and visited Europe for five concerts.

The group's initial idea began when Yamashita wanted to start a rock band and invited Kohama to join him. Good Charlotte's influences are seen on their first album, Zeitakubyō; while the Foo Fighters' influences can be seen on their second and third albums, Beam of Light and Kanjō Effect.\n\nIn their sixth album Jinsei×Boku=, they mentioned that this album was influenced heavily by Linkin Park's screaming and yell-rapping. Their seventh album 35xxxv, was produced along with producer John Feldmann. The album reached first place on the Oricon Album weekly ranking, making it the first time the band had reached the top of the list. In addition, it was the first One Ok Rock album to be released in a separate English language international edition in addition to the Japanese version. Their eighth album Ambitions also topped the Oricon Album weekly ranking.\n\nWith regards to songwriting, Taka said that he always needed a theme he could write about and he usually concentrates on what kind of message he wants to convey and what he wants to express. Usually melodies come first and then he writes the lyrics in Japanese and English. However, since he is not a native speaker of English, American producers help him express his thoughts properly.\n\n\"I think it’s something I’ve always had within me. If someone asks me to create something, it’s not like I can’t do it. Melodies come to me 365 days a year—it’s kind of like a capsule toy machine (laughs). If I’m told to create, I can create\".\n\nAt the beginning of their career, the band was rebelling against \"the world\", feeling a sort of anger and frustration they directed at everything they saw. Later on this anger subsided and now they think they need to talk about societal and political problems in Japan and in the world. One Ok Rock do not agree with the established ways of the Japanese entertainment system and from the beginning they have been striving to show the world what Japanese music and culture is like.\n\nAlbums:\nZeitakubyo (2007)\nBeam of Light (2008)\nKanjō Effect (2008)\nNiche Syndrome (2010)\nZankyo Reference (2011)\nJinsei×Boku= (2013)\n35xxxv (2015)\nAmbitions (2017)\nEye of the Storm (2019)\nLuxury Disease (2022)\nDetox (2025)\n\nTours\/concerts:\n\nAs a headliner\n\nJapan\nShredder in the World (世の中シュレッダー) (2007)\nOne Ok Rock Tour 2008 \"What Time Is It Now?\" (2008)\nOne Ok Rock 2009 \"Emotion Effect\" Tour (2009)\n\"This is my own judgment\" Tour (2010)\nAnswer is aLive Tour (2011)\nOne Ok Rock 2011–2012\"残響リファレンス\"Tour (2011–2012)\n\"The Beginning\" Tour (2012)\nOne Ok Rock 2013 \"人生×君=\"Tour (2013)\nOne Ok Rock 2014 \"Mighty Long Fall at Yokohama Stadium\" (2014)\nOne Ok Rock 2015 \"35xxxv\" Japan Tour (2015)\nOne Thousand Miles Tour (2016)\nOne Ok Rock 2016 Special Live in Nagisaen (2016)\nOne Ok Rock 2017 \"Ambitions\" Arena Tour (2017)\nOne Ok Rock 2018 \"Ambitions\" Japan Dome Tour (2018)\nOne Ok Rock with Orchestra Japan Tour 2018 (2018)\nOne Ok Rock 2019-2020 \"Eye of the Storm\" Japan Tour (2019–2020)\nOne Ok Rock 2020 \"Field of Wonder\" at Stadium Live Streaming (2020)\nOne Ok Rock 2021 \"Day to Night Acoustic Sessions\" at Stellar Theater (2021)\nOne Ok Rock 2023 \"Luxury Disease\" Japan Dome Tour (2023)\nSUPER DRY SPECIAL LIVE Organized by ONE OK ROCK (2024) \nOne Ok Rock 2025 \"Detox\" Japan Tour (2025)\n\nInternational\n\"Start Walking The World Tour\" (2012)\n\"Who are you??

        "biografia":"Foals is a rock band which formed in Oxford, England in 2005.  The band consists of Yannis Philippakis (vocals, guitar), Jimmy Smith (guitar), Walter Gervers (bass) and Jack Bevan (drums). The band has released seven albums: \"Antidotes\" (2008), \"Total Life Forever\" (2010), \"Holy Fire\" (2013), \"What Went Down\" (2015), \"Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost, Pt. 1\" (2019) , \"Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost, Pt. 2\" (2019), and \"Life is Yours\" (2022). In January 2018, it was announced that Walter Gervers (bass) was leaving the band. Edwin Congreave (keyboard) announced his departure in September 2021. In May 2023, Gervers was reported as having re-joined the band.\n\nThe band was formed in 2005 by Philippakis and Bevan, both former members of math rock band The Edmund Fitzgerald, and Andrew Mears of Youthmovies. Mears left the band after their first single to focus on Youthmovies. In January 2018, it was announced that Walter Gervers was also leaving the band.\n\nIn early 2007, the band released the limited edition 7\" singles Hummer and Mathletics, both produced by Gareth Parton. In the summer of 2007 Foals began working on their debut album in New York. It was produced by Dave Sitek of TV On The Radio, however, the band decided to mix the album themselves, stating that Sitek made the first master copy of the album sound like \"it was recorded in the Grand Canyon\". Yannis has stated multiple times during various interviews that Foals and Dave Sitek are on good terms, even though the copy by Sitek was rejected by the band. \n\nFoals released their debut album, entitled Antidotes, on 24 March 2008 in the UK and 8 April 2008 in the US. The album was a commercial success in the United Kingdom, debuting at No. 3 in the UK Albums Charts. The album was a minor success in other countries, charting in Japan, France and the Netherlands. Non-UK versions of the album include the early Parton produced singles.\n\nIn August 2009, Foals started recording their second album at Svenska Grammofon Studion in Gothenburg, Sweden. The album, Total Life Forever, has been described by the band members as sounding like \"tropical prog\" and \"like the dream of an eagle dying\". The band have described the album as being \"a lot less funk\" than they had originally planned. The album was produced by Luke Smith, formerly of Clor, and its title is named after an element of Ray Kurzweil's theory of singularity. The band's frontman Yannis Philippakis has professed a long time interest in futurology, with it informing numerous songs on Total Life Forever.\n\nOn 1 March 2010, the promotional single \"Spanish Sahara\" was first played on Zane Lowe's show Radio 1. Foals' new website was updated that night with the release of a video for the track directed by longtime collaborator Dave Ma. On 6 March, the Total Life Forever site was officially launched. Puzzles revealed images, lyrics and sound clips of songs from the album. The last clip appeared on 12 March, and resulted with a password entry for the Foals' new website. The site was opened on 13 March and presented the whole new art concept and media including samples of songs, photos and videos. Lead single \"This Orient\" was released on 3 May 2010. The album was finally released on 10 May 2010. \"Spanish Sahara\" was later released as a full physical single in September 2010, featuring an edited remix starring the strings of London Contemporary Orchestra. The album was nominated for the 2010 Mercury Prize.\n\nhttp:\/\/foals.co.uk <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Foals\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Having been featured in Hot Press Magazine thrice, including a full page feature in their recent mental health Issue, the classically trained multi-instrumentalist is bringing a unique form of expression to the indie-pop scene.\n\nHis debut single ' Make you Alright' brings an end to a project which began a little under a year ago, when the initial demo was recorded in his attic. The 125 playlists he was added to on Spotify in only 3 weeks proves there is a promising future for this youngster.\n\nBands like Arctic Monkeys, MGMT and Tame Impala have been some of the few Somebody's Child has been linked to, so there is no surprise that this digital release has already been championed by popular music critics such as Nialler9, and radio DJ's from RTE, and BBC Northern Ireland.\n\nSomebody's Child and his new live band are getting ready to release tour dates in the coming weeks in preparation for a the much-anticipated second single coming January 2019. In the meantime, he continues to explore the different styles and elements of alternative-pop music, while effortlessly showcasing what it means to be a contemporary songwriter with songs that are both lyrically and melody driven, and a voice described by xKira Music as being \"a piece of paradise\". \"'Make You Alright' is really just the start of something big\" he quotes, hinting towards his next odyssey. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Somebody%27s+Child\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

From 1993 to 1997, Oldham performed and recorded in collaboration with dozens of other musicians under many different variations of Palace (Palace, Palace Flophouse, Palace Brothers, Palace Songs, Palace Music). From 1998 onwards he started calling himself Bonnie 'Prince' Billy. Oldham released just one record as Palace: 1995's The Mountain EP, although it is now listed on streaming platforms under Palace Music. Oldham says this EP, recorded in the winter time, features some of his darkest, most challenging songs.\n\n3. Palace are an alternative blues\/rock band from London combining laid back guitars with brooding vocals.\n\n4. A Dutch heavy metal\/rock band which released a 5-song cassette in 1989 or 1990.\n\n5. Palace is a Swedish melodic rock band founded by lead singer and multi-instrumentalist Michael Palace. Heavily influenced by 80’s imagery and sounds, Palace delivers a massive melodic rock\/AOR sound.  With layers of keyboards, Palace deliver a heavier sound than most in the genre, with guitars a dominating feature. Swirling keyboards, layers of guitars, and fast moving 80’s themed melodic hard rock is what is on offer on “Binary Music”. After the very warm reception of the debut album, ”Master Of The Universe”, Michael was very excited to get to work on the follow up and face the challenges that came with it. ”I wanted to make an album that will give the fans even more of what they enjoyed the last time around, all the while staying creative and not shying away from new musical ideas,” he says.  They released their second album, \"Binary Music\" on December 7, 2018. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Palace\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The band currently comprises Tom Chaplin (lead vocals, electric\/acoustic guitar), Tim Rice-Oxley (piano, synthesisers, bass guitar, backing vocals), Richard Hughes (drums, percussion, backing vocals), and Jesse Quin (bass guitar, acoustic\/electric guitar, backing vocals). Their original line-up included founder and guitarist Dominic Scott, who left in 2001.\n\nKeane achieved mainstream, international success with the release of their debut album Hopes and Fears in 2004. Topping the UK charts, the album won the 2005 Brit Award for Best British Album and was the second best-selling British album of 2004. It is one of the best-selling albums in UK chart history. Their second album, Under the Iron Sea, released in 2006, topped the UK album charts and debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200.

Cause and Effect was released on 20 September 2019. After the release of the album, the band embarked on the Cause and Effect Tour, visiting Europe and Latin America, before the remainder of the tour was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Keane_(band)\n\nStudio albums\nHopes and Fears (2004)\nUnder the Iron Sea (2006)\nPerfect Symmetry (2008)\nStrangeland (2012)\nCause and Effect (2019) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Keane\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Relocating to Bristol in 2019, the duo built their own studio and embraced a rawer, more intimate approach to both their music and performances.\n\nDespite being independent artists under labels like VLF Records, Jadu Heart has amassed over 300 million streams globally and cultivated a loyal fanbase through their emotionally resonant melodies and immersive live shows. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Jadu+Heart\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Volbeat is a heavy metal band from Denmark, founded in 2001. They released their first album, The Strength\/the Sound\/the Songs, in 2005 and the follow up, Rock the Rebel\/Metal the Devil, was released in Denmark on February 19, 2007, and in the rest of Europe on February 26, 2007. In March 2007, it topped the Danish album chart as the best selling album, the first metal album ever to do so.\n\nVolbeat was formed in 2001 after frontman Michael Poulsen split up his former band, Dominus. Volbeat plays a fusion of heavy metal and rockabilly. They are inspired by the rock n' roll legends Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash. No other Danish heavy rock band Volbeat has been able to get to position 18 at the Danish Top 100 for CD sales in over 10 years. This milestone was reached after their concert at the Roskilde Festival 2006.\n\nCritics have generally been positive towards The Strength \/ The Sound \/ The Songs. The German hard rock magazine RockHard gave it 10\/10 in a review.\n\nVolbeat is also praised for its live performances. Their concert at Roskilde Festival 2006 received a 6\/6 stars review in the Danish newspaper BT.\n\nIn week 8 of 2007, the record Rock The Rebel \/ Metal The Devil debuted as #1 in the Danish Top 40 for CD-sales and at the same time The Strength \/ The Sound \/ The Songs re-entered the chart at #21. Recently, the album achieved gold status for sales in Denmark.\n\nVolbeat opened the Roskilde Festival in 2007. Volbeat also supported Metallica together with Mnemic at their concert on Denmark July 13 of that year.\n\nMore recently, Volbeat was announced to do a seven-date European spring tour and to support legendary speed metal act Megadeth in Finland and in their home town, Copenhagen. They have also already announced a few festival appearances for the summer 2008.\n\nVolbeat has a large range of influences, which can be clearly heard in their music. On their official MySpace site Volbeat lists their influences in their own recognizable way:\n\n\"Everything from Elvis Presley to Napalm Death .. hail: Johnny Cash, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Ramones, Social Distortion, Motörhead, Black Sabbath, Dio, Megadeth, Metallica, Manic Street Preachers, Iron Maiden and bla bla bla bla...\"\n\nVolbeat's lyrics usually revolve around love, failed love or the power of a twisted mind. They thereby distance themselves from stereotypical heavy metal lyrics, although many of their most popular songs have very dark or sincere themes and plots.\n\nTheir first single was the cover version of Dusty Springfield's evergreen \"I Only Wanna Be With You\". The song doesn't differ much from the original with regard to the lyrics, but the accompanying music video is quite typical of Volbeat. In it, the band is seen with a classic microphone on top of a city roof.\n\nAnother popular feature of the band's lyrics are the returning \"series\" of songs. This is best represented with the songs \"Danny & Lucy (11 pm)\" and \"Fire Song\" from The Strength\/The Sound\/The Songs followed by \"Mr. & Mrs. Ness\" on Rock the Rebel\/Metal the Devil. The story is about the two desperate lovers, Danny and Lucy, who are killed in a car crash after Lucy runs away from her family.\n\n\"Dear Mr. and Mrs. Ness, I'm so sorry to bring you this - We believe we found your girl in an old burning car way up the hill\"\n\nIn the successor, \"Mr. & Mrs. Ness\", Lucy's mother commits suicide and the father is suspected for the murder:\n\n\"The old man is crying and he's lying - The blood on his hands' from his wife yeah\"\n\nThe story is followed further by \"Mary Ann's Place\" from Guitar Gangsters & Cadillac Blood, and was concluded with \"You Will Know\" off 2016's Seal the Deal & Let's Boogie.\n\nLineup\n\nMichael Poulsen - Vocals, guitar (ex-Dominus)\nRob Caggiano - Guitar (ex-Anthrax)\nKaspar Boye Larsen - Bass\nJon Larsen - Drums\n\nFormer members:\n\nTeddy Vang - Guitar\nFranz Gottschalk - Guitar\nThomas Bredahl - Guitar\nAnders Kjølholm - Bass\n\n\nOfficial homepage : www.volbeat.dk  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Volbeat\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Howard Jones (born John Howard Jones on February 23, 1955) is an English singer and songwriter.\n\nHe is the eldest of three boys. His birthplace is Southampton, England, and he spent his early years in High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, and attended the Royal Grammar School. He now lives with his family in Somerset, England.\n\nWhen he was young, he used to give piano lessons. One of his clients was a girl named Jan Smith, who he later married. Whilst working with her, a vehicle crashed into their van, injuring Jan. She claimed compensation and used the money to buy Howard a synthesiser, a Moog Prodigy. The shop delivered two by mistake, and Howard liked the combination of the two so much that he paid for the extra one.\n\nHe hit the charts in 1983 with a song called \"New Song,\" which made it into the UK top ten. Speaking with Songfacts, Jones explained the song is his manifesto, and why he wanted to get in the music business and write songs to begin with. Said Jones: \"I was working in the factory at the time - I was doing the gigs at night and I was working in the factory. And I wanted to say to people, 'You can. It is possible to do what you really want to do if you've got enough guts and determination. You can do what you're really good at in this life if you set your mind to it.' And so really that's what that song's about. It's about letting go of fear and seeing both sides of an argument and throwing off the things that hold you back mentally.\"\n\nJones subsequently had three more hits over the next twelve months and a UK Number 1 album, Human's Lib. He acquired a hardcore fanbase made up of both starstruck teenagers and more mature music lovers, who saw the musicianship which went into the electronic sounds of his songs. His mother ran his fan club. Jones was a close temporal and stylistic contemporary of Nik Kershaw, and the two musicians were often conflated in the affections of the contemporary pop audience.\n\nHoward was known as a respectable face of pop, combining innovative synthesiser music with strong feelings on animal rights and life's excesses. In his early days, he performed with a mime artist called Jed Hoile, who used to do improvised choreography while doused in white paint as Howard played behind him.\n\nIn the summer of 1984, he released a single called \"Like To Get To Know You Well\", which he said was 'dedicated to the original spirit of the Olympic Games'. Although it wasn't an official Olympic anthem for the Games in Los Angeles that summer, it caught on and was a huge worldwide hit. The sleeve featured the song title in ten different languages; while Howard sang the title line in French and German on the extended version. The song appeared in the film Better Off Dead.\n\nHoward's second album was a ground breaking 'remix' album. It contained six songs, all but one of which had been previously released, but which appeared in elongated formats, including the multi-lingual version of \"Like To Get To Know You Well\". The album was called The 12 Inch Album and the sleeve featured a miniature Howard standing next to a 12-inch ruler.\n\nWhen he released his second studio album, Dream Into Action, in 1985, he introduced his own backing band, including future Soul II Soul singer Caron Wheeler as one third of female backing vocal trio Afrodiziak. Playing bass guitar, meanwhile, was Howard's own brother Martin, who had to have an extra string added to his instrument to play some of Howard's bass lines, which were originally played on a keyboard without regard for the range of a real bass guitar. One of the singles released from this album, \"No One Is To Blame\", was later re-recorded and featured Phil Collins as drummer and producer.\n\nIn July 1985, Howard performed at Wembley Stadium as part of the Live Aid concert, singing his 1984 hit \"Hide And Seek\" while playing a piano belonging to Freddie Mercury.\n\nHoward had his last UK Top 40 hit in 1986 and thereafter concentrated on production, songwriting and running a successful vegetarian restaurant, though he had Billboard Top 10 success in the States in the 1990s. His eldest son, Oisín (pronounced Osheen), was born in 1985 and is now an actor.\n\nIn 2005, he competed on the American TV show Hit Me Baby One More Time, losing to Irene Cara. Although he lost the in-studio vote to Cara, he won the online poll vote.\n\nThere are other artists with the same name:\n\n2. Howard Jones is the current lead singer of American metalcore bands Killswitch Engage and Blood Has Been Shed.\n\nJones resides in Connecticut. His first success was in Connecticut with the band Blood Has Been Shed. After the release of The Novella of Uriel, the band went on tour, but Jones was eventually approached for a bigger project. Howard Jones replaced the lead singer of Killswitch Engage, Jesse Leach, in July of 2002, shortly after the release of Alive or Just Breathing, Killswitch Engage's Roadrunner Records debut album.\n\nMeanwhile, Blood Has Been Shed released their third album, Spirals in 2003. Critical reviews were mixed, with some saying the album was a bit stray from the music found on I Dwell and Novella, while fans found it to be the band's most sonically-challenging album yet.\n\nThe first time KSE fans heard Jones they were impressed by him. Later he would be heard on the song \"When Darkness Falls\", which was first released on the soundtrack for the movie Freddy vs. Jason. Finally, Killswitch Engage released their first album with Jones as the new singer, as well as Blood Has Been Shed drummer Justin Foley. The End of Heartache would spawn two successful singles, \"Rose of Sharyn\" and the Grammy-nominated title track, \"The End of Heartache\". There was a minor spot of controversy with some fans over the Grammy nomination, as the song that was picked was a remixed version that would eventually appear on the Resident Evil: Apocalypse soundtrack. The differences between the original recording and the remixed version are the fact that the song is sung in a traditional singing style rather than using the original scream track that appears on the album, and several sections of the song have been shortened for a more commercially dynamic vision.\n\nIn November 2006, Killswitch Engage released their fourth album (and second with Howard Jones) entitled As Daylight Dies. The album has spawned the singles \"My Curse\" and \"Arms of Sorrow\", and it has been cited by the band through numerous interviews that the album recalls influences from bands in the NOLA music scene, as well as metal bands like Pantera and Machine Head.\n\nDespite his front man role in Killswitch Engage, Jones is still the lead singer for Blood Has Been Shed.\n\nAside from singing, Jones has also taken on the role of a manager to new and upcoming artists. Currently, he manages two bands, Twelve Tribes, Mikoto, and also the producer Zeuss.\n\nHe is also known for his vocal styles, which include deep, booming roars, a higher, raspier scream, and operatic clean vocals. The clean style is absent from most of his work with Blood Has Been Shed, however, with Killswitch Engage, he usually makes use of all of his vocal styles in almost every song, particularly in As Daylight Dies and Holy Diver.\n\n3.  Howard Jones is an English folk singer and musician.  He was a member of The Electropathics  and currently performs with Albireo and as a solo performer. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Howard+Jones\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"The Animals was a British rock band of the 1960s, formed in Newcastle. They were part of the British Invasion, being one of the most popular bands of their era. Known for their gritty, raw, bluesy sound and hard-voiced frontman Eric Burdon, as exemplified by their signature songs House of the Rising Sun and Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood, the band underwent numerous personnel changes, while influencing the later heavy metal music with the riffs of their rock songs such as We Gotta Get Out Of This Place and It's my Life. They emerged as an exponent of psychedelic music before dissolving at the end of the decade. In 1983 they had a comeback and toured for six months before disbanding forever.\n\nHistory\nFirst incarnation\n\nFormed in Newcastle-upon-Tyne during 1962 and 1963 when Burdon joined the existing Alan Price Rhythm and Blues Combo, the original line-up comprised Eric Burdon (vocals), Alan Price (organ and keyboards), Hilton Valentine (guitar), John Steel (drums), and Bryan \"Chas\" Chandler (bass). The Animals' moderate success in their hometown and a connection with The Yardbirds manager Giorgio Gomelsky motivated them to move to London in 1964, in time to be grouped with the British Invasion. They performed fiery versions of the staple rhythm and blues repertoire (Jimmy Reed, John Lee Hooker, Nina Simone, etc). Signed to the Columbia Graphophone subsidiary of EMI, a rocking version of the standard \"Baby Let Me Follow You Down\" (retitled Baby Let Me Take You Home) was their first UK hit single.\n\nIt was followed in June 1964 by the huge transatlantic hit \"House of the Rising Sun\". Burdon's howling vocals and the dramatic arrangement created arguably the first folk rock hit. Whether the arrangement was inspired by Bob Dylan's version of the song (which in turn was inspired by folk singer Dave Van Ronk) or by blues singer Josh White's (who recorded it twice in 1944 and 1949) or by singer\/pianist Nina Simone (who recorded it in 1962 on At The Village Gate, predating Dylan's interpretation) remains a subject of dispute, as does whether all five Animals deserved credit for the arrangement and not just Price.\n\nThe Animals' two-year chart career, masterminded by producer Mickie Most, featured singles that were intense, gritty pop covers such as Sam Cooke's Bring It On Home To Me and the Nina Simone number Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood. In contrast their album tracks stayed with rhythm and blues, with Hooker's Boom Boom and Ray Charles' I Believe to My Soul being notable examples. Burdon's powerful, deep voice and the use of keyboards as much or more than guitars were two elements that made the Animals' sound stand out.\n\nBy May 1965 the group was starting to feel internal pressures. Price left due to personal and musical differences as well as a fear of flying on tour; he went on to a successful career as a solo artist and with the Alan Price Set. Mickey Gallagher filled in for him on keyboards for a spell, until Dave Rowberry replaced him and was on hand for the hit working-class anthems We Gotta Get Out of this Place and It's My Life. Around that time, an Animals Big Band even made a one-time appearance.\n\nMany of The Animals' hits had come from Brill Building songwriters recruited by Most; the group, and Burdon in particular, felt this was too restrictive. As 1965 ended the group switched to Decca Records and producer Tom Wilson, who gave them more artistic freedom. In early 1966 MGM Records, their American label, collected their hits onto The Best of The Animals; it became their best-selling album in the U.S. In February 1966 Steel left and was replaced by Barry Jenkins; a leftover cover of Goffin-King's Don't Bring Me Down and the powerful hard rock tune See See Rider were the last hits as The Animals.\n\nBy this time their business affairs \"were in a total shambles,\" according to Chandler (who would go on to manage Jimi Hendrix), and the group disbanded. Even by the standards of the day, when artists tended to be financially naïve, the Animals made very little money from their successes, eventually claiming mismanagement and theft on the part of their manager Mike Jeffery.\n\nSecond incarnation\n\nA group with Burdon, Jenkins, and new sidemen John Weider (guitar\/violin\/bass), Vic Briggs alias Antion (guitar\/piano), and Danny McCulloch (bass) was formed under the name Eric Burdon and the New Animals (or sometimes just Eric Burdon & the Animals) in October 1966, and changed direction. The hard-driving blues was transformed into Burdon's version of psychedelia, as the former heavy-drinking Geordie (who later said he could never get used to Newcastle, \"where the rain comes at you sideways\") relocated to California and became a spokesman for the Love Generation, but also a former heavy metal act and one of the upcoming stars of the genre such as Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple..\n\nSome of this group's hits included \"San Franciscan Nights\", \"Monterey\" (a tribute to the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival), and the anti-war \"Sky Pilot\". There were further changes to this line-up: George Bruno (a\/k\/a Zoot Money, keyboards) was added in April 1968, and in July 1968 Andy Summers [sic] (guitar)—later of The Police—replaced Briggs and McCulloch.\n\nBy 1969 these Animals had dissolved, and Eric Burdon joined forces with a Latin group from Long Beach, California called War.\nThe first hit under Eric Burdon & War was the funky\/chill-out song Spill the Wine. The Group with 8 members disbanded in July 1971.\n\nLater incarnations\n\nThe original Animals line-up of Burdon, Price, Valentine, Chandler, and Steel briefly reunited for a benefit concert in Newcastle in 1968, for an album in 1977 and again for an album and tour (supplemented by Zoot Money on keyboards and Steve Grant on guitar) in 1983. Chandler died in 1996.\n\nIn the 2000s Burdon has toured with a new set of musicians under the name \"Eric Burdon and the Animals\".

        "biografia":"Allah-Las is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 2008 around a mutual love for records, Los Angeles history, and the beach. The band members are all surfers and cover the city from the East Side (Mt. Washington) to way out West (Venice Beach) - and their sound reflects the geography of the city. The group consists of Miles Michaud, singer and guitarist, Pedrum Siadatian, electric guitar and vocals, Spencer Dunham, Electric Bass and vocals, and Matthew Correia, drums, percussion and vocals.\n\nSince coming together as a band, they cut their teeth playing numerous California dates with groups like Entrance Band, Tyde, Tijuana Panthers, and the Growlers, and have garnered the approval of original UK Psych founding-father Patrick Campbell-Lyons (Nirvana). In the Los Angeles musical community, they gained a reputation as a laid-back, grooving band with strong ties to the authentically LA-centric sounds of bands like the Byrds, Love, and early Captain Beefheart. \n\nThe group released their third album, Calico Review, on September 9, 2016. On November 3, 2017, the band released the EP Covers #1. The EP consists of four covers of songs by George Harrison, Television, Kathy Heideman, and Further. In October 2019, the band released the album LAHS. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Allah-Las\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"In 2014, something unusual happened. On the strength of their breakthrough album Too Many Roads, Denmark’s Thorbjørn Risager & The Black Tornado went global.\n\nNow it’s one thing for an artist from Copenhagen to enjoy success at home and in a few adjacent countries. But the release of Too Many Roads saw the seven-piece combo fronted by singer and guitarist Risager gaining widespread notoriety in the U.S. and being invited to play in locales as far away as Mumbai, India. The album took home the Danish Music Award as the Top Blues Album of 2014 and also earned Germany’s illustrious “Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik,” but perhaps even more impressively, it was selected as one the year’s best by Britain’s influential The Blues magazine, right alongside international stars like Robert Cray, Walter Trout and Joe Bonamassa. Clearly, Risager and his mates had taken their exhilarating mix of blues, soul and rock ‘n’ roll to the next level.\n\nEarly in 2015, Thorbjørn Risager & The Black Tornado celebrated that triumph by returning to one of their favorite nightspots – the Harmonie in Bonn, Germany. They would treat local fans to a one-of-a-kind spectacle, hitting the stage as a ten-piece mini-orchestra. After Thomas Ruf of Ruf Records introduces this deluxe edition of the band – including a three-man horn section and backing vocalists Ida Bang und Lisa Lystam – the colossal sound of Risager’s semi-hollow body spearheads the all-out attack of opening number “If You Wanna Leave.” He and his Black Tornado are off to the races…\n\nThe succeeding 100-minute concert, captured on CD and DVD for the newest addition to Ruf’s Songs from the Roadseries, shows off every facet of this unique conglomeration of musicians. There’s the sinuous funk of “Paradise” and the furious boogie of “The Straight and Narrow Line” (featuring big-time playing by piano man Emil Balsgaard and saxophonist Hans Nybo). There’s the twin-guitar blues of “Too Many Roads” and the rough-and-tumble attitude of “Rock ‘n’ Roll Ride.” There’s the chilling “China Gate” and the dark drama of “Long Forgotten Track.” Finally, the band whips the crowd into frenzy with their ultra-groovy take on the classic “Baby Please Don’t Go” and the timeless party anthem “Let The Good Times Roll,” the latter track showcasing the talents of lead guitarist Peter Skjerning. The funk workout “Opener” and the charming “I Won’t Let You Down” (performed as a duet with Lisa Lystam) offer some welcome after play.\n\nMore than anything, Songs from the Road shows that the success of Too Many Roads was no fluke. Thorbjørn Risager and his highly skilled accomplices have perfected a spicy blend of musical ingredients. The hundreds of shows they’ve played during the past few years have them running like a well-oiled machine. More great things can be expected of them in the future – but until then, we have this brilliant document of a band that is quietly revolutionizing the way we look at the blues.\n\nThe Black Tornado band\nThorbjørn Risager – leadvoc, gtr\nEmil Balsgaard – keys\nPeter Skjerning – gtr,voc\nKasper Wagner – alto-\/barythonsax\nHans Nybo – tenorsax, voc\nPeter Kehl – trumpet, perc, voc,\nSøren Bøjgaard – bass\nMartin Seidelin – drums, perc, voc,\n\nThe Tornadettes (guest appearance on “Songs from the road” and on special occasions!)\nIda Bang – voc\nLisa Lystam – voc\n\nBAND FACTS\n● Nominated for a British Blues Award 2014 & 2015\n● Winner of the Danish Music Award 2013 & 2014\n● The band was founded in 2003 and 5 of the band members have been there\nsince the start.\n● In 2005 their cooperation with Annika Westman started who has booked\nmore than 700 concerts for them in 21 countries.\n● Songs From The Road is their 10th album in 10 years!\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Thorbj%C3%B8rn+Risager+&+The+Black+Tornado\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

He was also influenced by artists like Doug E. Fresh, Biz Markie, Bobby McFerrin, Buffy of the Fat Boys, and Al Jarreau.\n\nRahzel has expanded the art of beatboxing in a unique way, creating vocal beats while singing lyrics simultaneously, as is best displayed by his famous a cappella performance of \"If Your Mother Only Knew\" (an interpretation of Aaliyah's song \"If Your Girl Only Knew\") of which an MP3 is in wide circulation.\n\nRahzel has been performing live with musician and vocalist Mike Patton (Faith No More, Fantômas, etc.) as \"Patton & Rahzel\".\n\nRahzel released his album Make The Music 2000 in 1999 on the MCA record label, followed by the 2004 release of the album Rahzel's Greatest Knockouts for Sureshot Recordings on which he collaborates with many other artists.\n\nIn 2004, Rahzel collaborated with Björk and other beatboxers for her album Medúlla. His beatboxing skills are also featured on The Crystal Method's album Legion of Boom, in which he provides the vocals for the song \"The American Way\" and others on the album. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Rahzel\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Boy Harsher is an American electronic \/ darkwave duo, formed in 2013, that produces gritty dance beats infused with ethereal vocals, creating a sound that is eerie, intense and incredibly danceable. Gus Muller of Reconss develops the underbelly of sound with minimal beats and grinding synths, where Jae Matthews whispers, screams and chants on top. Together, the music created is somewhere between dance, trance and confessional storytelling. Boy Harsher draws heavily from cinema, theatrics and graphic design to tailor the band's visual imagery; Matthews and Muller both have a background in filmmaking. They have likened the band to the movies Body Heat and Lost Highway, latter of which was directed by David Lynch, a professed influence on the band. Matthews has expressed appreciation for various female vocalists, including Nico, Circuit des Yeux, Alison Lewis of Linea Aspera, Chelsea Wolfe and Zola Jesus, whereas Muller named Sleep Chamber, Suicide, DAF and Yello as early musical influences on Boy Harsher.[4] Gearwise, Muller mostly employs synthesizers and samplers, stating that he \"tries and borrows as much [instruments] as he can for recording.\"On the band's minimal instrumentation, he said: \"I’m obsessed with how successful the minimalism is with 80s music. It’s really a masterclass of what can be done with a drum machine and a couple of synths. A \"half-functioning\" Roland Juno-106 was used extensively on Lesser Man EP; their live set features synth lines sampled into an Akai MPC, as well as backing tracks. The band has amassed a cult following since their formation. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Boy+Harsher\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Garrett Seamans is a lo-fi indie musician based in Los Angeles, California. He is known for his music projects postcard boy and later carwash. \n\nBorn in San Diego, California, he grew up playing saxophone during his fourth-grade years. However, his experience in the school band did not resonate with him, leading him to discontinue formal training. A pivotal moment occurred when he became enamored with the ukulele, influenced by his older sister's engagement with the instrument. This familial connection played a significant role in shaping his musical pursuits.\n\nSeamans' foray into music production began during middle school when he engaged in editing surf videos set to the backdrop of the EDM scene on Soundcloud. Seamans' musical interests evolved in high school, gravitating towards indie pop, rock, and the alternative music landscape. These inclinations prompted the inception of his project postcard boy, characterized by electronic-infused vocals and increasingly alternative instrumentals. The name \"postcard boy\" came from the lyrics \"can I be your postcard boy\", from a song he wrote but scrapped. He liked the thought of staying in touch via letters, so he kept the lyric as a moniker. \n\nHis artistic journey took a new turn with the emergence of the moniker carwash in 2019. This endeavor provided Seamans with an avenue to experiment with a distinct alternative rock influence, diverging from the sonic landscape of postcard boy. \"Carwash\" was just one of many aliases he had written down that he thought was funny.\n\nQuietly, he dropped the song \"striptease\" while in the midst of directing six music videos for his postcard boy EP called \"Limbo\". Over the course of the next year carwash continued to grow, releasing follow up singles \"supermarket\" and \"punch22\" as well as continuing to drop postcard boy tracks (\"Picture Book\" and \"skydive\"). \n\nSeamans' creative output was marked by a multifaceted approach that embraced both music and visual arts. Seamans, armed with a background in film and photography, seamlessly integrated the visual elements into his artistic endeavors, crafting immersive worlds for his projects. In 2021, he released the first carwash project called \"soap water\". Along with this, he wrote, directed, and produced a short film titled \"soap water: the movie\" that accompanies the EP, telling a light-hearted story that is soundtracked chronologically by the five song project. With a background in film and photography, the visual aspect of both carwash and postcard boy is integral to the world each builds out. \n\nSeamans re-emerged with postcard boy's album \"Somewhere ON A Hillside,\" which debuted on July 28, 2023. Now neither artist project holds the front seat, but instead focus him as an artist to exploring distinct sonic spaces and visual identities. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Carwash\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Gary Clark Jr. (born February 15, 1984) is an American guitarist and actor based in Austin, Texas. Described as being the future of Texas blues, Clark's resume has included sharing the stage with various legends of rock and roll. He has stated that he is \"influenced by blues, jazz, soul [and] country, as well as hip hop\". Clark's musical trademarks are his extremely fuzzy guitar sound and smooth vocal style.\n\n\nGARY CLARK JR.began playing guitar in 1996 at the ripe young age of 12. Born and raised in Austin, TX, Gary continued to play small gigs throughout his early teens, until he popped on the radar of legendary promoter Clifford Antone, owner of the Austin blues club Antone's. Through Clifford's connections, Gary soon began sitting in and learning from an array of musical icons, including the incomparable Jimmie Vaughan. \n\nJimmie and others in the Austin music community mentored Gary along his path, facilitating his steady rise, and continued ascent in the Texas music scene. Gary's musical peers, as well as the Austin music community at-large, have showered him with critical acclaim for his galvanized live performances, and fervid expression. At one unexpected point of political recognition, mayor of Austin Kirk Watson proclaimed May 3, 2001 Gary Clark Jr Day. Gary was 18 years old at the time.\n\nGary went on to win the Austin Music Award for Best Blues and Electric Guitarist on three separate occasions, in addition to receiving awards from various Blues magazines and associations around the country. After playing the nationally televised show Austin City Limits and touring with the likes of artists such as Jimmie Vaughan, Pinetop Perkins, and Doyle Bramhall II, he continued his recording pursuits by releasing three self-produced albums, and creating the original score for the major motion picture Full Count. His creative versatility allowed him to transcend his own musical talents, while also starring as a principal character in John Sayle’s film Honeydripper, alongside actors Danny Glover and Stacy Keach.\n\nOriginally known as a blues musician and even compared to such greats as Stevie Ray Vaughan, Albert Collins and Albert King, Gary is stepping out...way out.  His upcoming CD will really test his blues fans.  Will they appreciate Gary's guitar chops and his soulful voice as he explores other genres?  Gary hopes so and he hopes they will continue with him on his journey.  And with this new sound, we're thinking Gary will pick up some new fans along the way.\n\nHIs first major label LP \"Blak and Blu\" was released on October 22, 2012 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Gary+Clark+Jr.\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Five for Fighting is the stage name of U.S. singer-songwriter John Ondrasik. His latest work being 2013's 'Bookmarks', his breakout into international success came with his 2000 album 'America Town', which went platinum in the U.S. due to the widespread acclaim of his song \"Superman (It's Not Easy)\" in late 2001. His 2004 album 'The Battle For Everything' has also enjoyed considerable chart success in the U.S. Ondrasikhas released a DualDisc of his 2004 album as well, with has one side containing 'The Battle for Everything' in its entirety and the other side being a DVD containing bonus footage and the \"100 Years\" music video.\n\nJohn Ondrasik was born in the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles. He grew up there in a musical family, with his mother teaching him the piano from the age of two. As a teenager, he learned how to play the guitar as well and started to write music. While he also learned to sing opera briefly, he quickly decided that he would like to be a piano playing popular musician along the lines of Elton John and Billy Joel. Ondrasik adopted the name \"Five for Fighting\" which is an expression in ice hockey when a player is sent from the rink by the referee for a major penalty. The name was used for the reason that it would be more memorable than his real name.\n\nIn 1997, his first album, 'Message for Albert', was released by EMI. Although not quite breaking through commercially, fans of modern singer-songwriter music provided a warm audience for Ondrasik. After the success of 'America Town', Capitol Records re-released this debut album to give it a more mainstream audience.\n\nIn 2000, Ondrasik signed with the aforementioned Columbia Records and released 'America Town' on September 26, 2000. At first, it made little impact until track \"Superman (It's Not Easy)\" became an American anthem after the September 11 attacks. Ondrasik performed the song at 'The Concert for New York Cit'y in late 2001.\n\n\"Superman (It's Not Easy)\" started climbing the charts reaching the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Billboard Adult Top 40. While 'America Town' itself failed to make the top 50 of the Billboard 200 album charts, its consistent sales led to it going platinum. \"Superman (It's Not Easy)\" was also an international hit reaching number one on a composite adult international chart (based on performance in the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Australia). Ondrasik's second single, \"Easy Tonight\", would make the top 20 of the world adult chart as well as going top 20 in New Zealand.\n\nHis third album, 'The Battle for Everything', debuted at number 20 on the Billboard 200 in February 2004. Its first single, \"100 Years\", was another top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and again reached number one on the World Adult Top 40. It also was number one on a composite world airplay chart and top 10 on a composite world modern rock chart. (based on USA, Germany, United Kingdom, Finland, Sweden, Canada and Australia).\n\nThe Five for Fighting song \"100 Years\" was used in a ubiquitous JP Morgan Chase commercial, and more recently in an episode of Scrubs. The song was also used in the last scenes of the final episode of JAG.\n\nLately, Ondrasik's sixth album, 2013's 'Bookmarks', came out after a four year gap between his last release. The album has received critical praise from a variety of publications such as Allmusic, where the reviewer lauded how Five for Fighting produced \" sturdy tunes wrapped up neatly in a shiny, appealing gloss\". Released by the label Universal, his work also hit the #54 slot on the Billboard 200, with his fans happily looking forwards to his future endeavors.\n\nSee more at: http:\/\/www.fiveforfighting.com\/ <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Five+for+Fighting\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Freddie Mercury (September 5, 1946 – November 24, 1991) was a rock musician, best known as the frontman and lead singer for the English rock band Queen. He is remembered for his powerful vocal abilities and charisma as a live performer. As a songwriter, he composed many international hits, including Killer Queen, Bohemian Rhapsody, Somebody to Love, We Are the Champions, Bicycle Race, Don't Stop Me Now, and Crazy Little Thing Called Love. Mercury died from complications of AIDS, greatly increasing public awareness of the disease.\n\nFreddie Mercury was born Farrokh Bulsara in Stone Town on the African island of Unguja (the largest island of the Zanzibar archipelago - at the time a British colony, now part of Tanzania). His parents, Bomi and Jer Bulsara, were Indian Parsis, descendents of 10th century Persian Zoroastrians immigrants in India. The family had emigrated to Zanzibar in order for Bomi to continue his job as a middle-ranking cashier at the British Colonial Office. Mercury had one younger sister, Kashmira.\n\nMercury was sent back to India to attend St. Peter's boarding school near Bombay (now Mumbai). It was at St. Peter's where he learned to play the piano and joined his first band, The Hectics. He stayed in India for most of his childhood, living with his grandmother and aunt. Mercury completed his education in India at St. Mary's High School in Mazagon before returning to Zanzibar. He was 17 when he and his family finally fled to England, as a result of the 1964 Zanzibar Revolution. In England, he earned a Diploma in Art and Graphic Design at Ealing Art College, following in the footsteps of Pete Townshend. He later used these skills in order to design the Queen crest.\n\nWidely considered as one of the greatest vocalists in popular music, Freddie Mercury possessed a very distinctive voice. Although his speaking voice naturally fell in the baritone range, his singing voice was that of a tenor. His recorded vocal range spanned nearly four octaves (falsetto included), with his lowest recorded note being the F below the bass clef and his highest recorded note being the D that lies nearly four octaves above. In addition to vocal range, Mercury often delivered technically difficult songs in a powerful manner. However, due in part to the fact that he suffered from vocal nodules (for which he declined surgery), he would often lower the highest notes during many concerts. Mercury also claimed that he never had any formal vocal training.\n\nAs a songwriter, Mercury wrote ten out of the seventeen songs on Queen's Greatest Hits album, including Seven Seas of Rhye, Killer Queen, Bohemian Rhapsody, Somebody to Love, Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy, We Are the Champions, Bicycle Race, Don't Stop Me Now, Crazy Little Thing Called Love, and Play The Game. However, by the 1980s, all four members of the band were writing hits. The most notable aspect of his songwriting involved the wide range of different genres that he used, which included, among other styles, rockabilly, heavy metal and disco. Compared to many rock songwriters, many of Freddie Mercury's songs were musically complex. As an example, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is acyclic in structure and comprises nearly sixty chords. On the other hand, \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" is made up of only a few chords. Despite the fact that Mercury often wrote very intricate harmonies, he claimed that he could barely read music.\n\nAlthough all four members of the band Queen were songwriters, producer Gary Langan, who worked in the studio with Queen on many of their early albums, notes that \"Freddie was always intensely supportive of other people's songwriting and would give as much attention to one of the other's as he would to his own. It was so unlike other bands I've worked with where there is an acknowledged songwriter and anyone else who writes one really has to hassle to get it anywhere.\" Mercury wrote most of his songs on the piano, often choosing keys that were technically difficult for band mate and guitarist Brian May (e.g. E flat major). Although he possessed only rudimentary skills on the guitar, Mercury wrote many lines and riffs for the instrument, including many of those heard in \"Bohemian Rhapsody.\" He also wrote \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" on the guitar.\n\nIn addition to his work with Queen, Mercury produced two solo albums, Mr. Bad Guy and Barcelona, released in 1985 and 1988, respectively. The former was a pop-oriented album that emphasized disco and dance music. \"Barcelona\" was recorded with the opera singer Montserrat Caballé, whom Mercury had long admired.\n\nAlthough it remained on the UK Album Charts for 23 weeks, \"Mr. Bad Guy\" was not considered to have been a commercial success relative to most Queen albums. However, in 1993, a remix of \"Living On My Own\", a single from the album, reached the #1 position on the UK Singles Charts. The song remained on the charts for thirteen weeks and garnered Mercury a posthumous Ivor Novello Award. All Music critic David Prato descibes \"Mr. Bad Guy\" as \"outstanding from start to finish\" and expressed his view that Mercury \"did a commendable job of stretching into uncharted territory.\" [14] In particular, the album was heavily synthesizer-driven in a way that was uncharacteristic of previous Queen albums.\n\n“Barcelona”, recorded with opera singer Montserrat Caballé, combined elements of popular music and opera. Caballé considered the album to have been one of the great successes of her career and said of Mercury, “He was not only a popular singer, he was a musician, that could sit at the piano and compose. He discovered a new way to bring different music styles together. He is the first and only person to have done this.” In September of 2006, a compilation album featuring Mercury’s solo work was released in the UK in honour of what would have been his sixtieth birthday. The album debuted in the top 10 of the UK Album Charts. \n\nOver the years, rare Freddie Mercury solo albums have greatly increased in value. For instance, a Japanese single of the song “Guide Me Home” from the Barcelona album is now worth as much as £1,000 ($1,800).Another valuable item is a 1973 cover of the  1969  Beach Boys song, I Can Hear Music recorded under the stage name Larry Lurex. Widely bootlegged, the original record is now a valuable collectible.\n\nMercury collaborated with Michael Jackson on some tracks which were never officially released, including “There Must Be More To Life Than This” and “State of Shock”, which were both leaked to the internet. Mercury also recorded another track with Michael Jackson called \"Victory\" that has yet to be released to the public. The latter song, released on the 1984 Victory album, was ultimately performed by Mick Jagger and The Jacksons. Mercury was originally scheduled to appear on the Thriller album as well.\n\nAlthough he had a very close girlfriend named Mary Austin for many years, Freddie Mercury had always been fairly open about his homosexuality. In a March 12, 1974 interview for New Musical Express, he told the interviewer: 'I am as gay as a daffodil, my dear!'[18] Beginning in the mid 1970s, Mercury began a series of affairs with men, which ultimately resulted in the end of his relationship with Austin. However, the two remained close friends through the years, and Mercury often referred to Austin as his only true friend.[19] In a 1985 interview, Mercury said of Austin, \"All my lovers asked me why they couldn't replace Mary (Austin), but it's simply impossible. The only friend I've got is Mary, and I don't want anybody else. To me, she was my common-law wife. To me, it was a marriage. We believe in each other, that's enough for me. I couldn't fall in love with a man the same way as I have with Mary.\"[20]\n\nIn 1983, Mercury found a new lover named Jim Hutton. Hutton lived with Mercury for the last six years of his life, cared for him when he was ill, and was at his bedside when he died. According to Hutton, Mercury referred to him as his husband, and died wearing a wedding band that Hutton had given him.\n\nMercury possessed a notable overbite of his teeth that he had wanted to fix for many years. Early in his career, he commented that he wished to have work done, but regretted that he did not have time to do it. He also expressed fears that such an operation might damage his voice. While smiling Mercury would often cover his mouth with his hand, in an attempt to hide the overbite.\n\nAccording to the January 2004 edition of Cat Fancy, Mercury possessed a great fondness for cats, at one point owning as many as ten. Mercury's personal assistant, Peter Freestone, wrote that his boss \"put as much importance on them [his cats] as any human life.\"[23] The album Mr. Bad Guy and the song Delilah were dedicated to cats, and Mercury wore clothes featuring cats in videos and on album covers.\n\nMercury kept his Indian descent a secret from most of his fans, rarely mentioning his heritage in interviews. He would sometimes refer to himself as \"Persian,\" perhaps alluding to his identity as a Parsi. Many friends expressed their view that Mercury felt ashamed of his ethnic origins and feared racial backlash in a country that had long been troubled by race riots and violence against Indian immigrants. On the other hand, fellow band mate Roger Taylor suggested that Mercury downplayed his heritage simply because he did not feel that it would fit well with his rock musician persona.\n\nAccording to Mercury's partner, Jim Hutton, Mercury was diagnosed with HIV in the spring of 1987. Mercury claimed to have tested negative in an interview published that year, and continued to deny that he had HIV. Despite these denials, the British press continued to pursue the rampant rumours about Mercury's health. The rumours were likely fueled by Mercury's appearance in the last years of his life: he appeared increasingly gaunt, particularly in his last appearance on film, the These Are the Days of Our Lives promo video, which suggested serious illness.\n\nOn November 22, 1991, Mercury called Queen's manager Jim Beach over to his Kensington home, to discuss a public statement. The next day, November 23, the following announcement was made to the press:\n\n“Following the enormous conjecture in the press over the last two weeks, I wish to confirm that I have been tested HIV positive and have AIDS. I felt it correct to keep this information private to date to protect the privacy of those around me. However, the time has come now for my friends and fans around the world to know the truth and I hope that everyone will join with my doctors and all those worldwide in the fight against this terrible disease. My privacy has always been very special to me and I am famous for my lack of interviews. Please understand this policy will continue. ” \n\nA little over 24 hours after issuing the statement, Freddie Mercury died at the age of 45. The official cause of death was bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS.[25] Although he had not attended religious services in years, Mercury's funeral was conducted by a Zoroastrian priest. He was cremated at Kensal Green Cemetery, and the whereabouts of his ashes are unknown, although some believe them to have been dispersed into Lake Geneva, or in his family's possession. The remaining members of Queen founded The Mercury Phoenix Trust, and organised The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. He left £500,000 to his chef, £500,000 to his personal assistant, £100,000 to his driver, and £500,000 to his partner, Jim Hutton. Mary Austin, his life-long friend, inherited the estate and now lives there with her family.\n\nAs a child, Freddie Mercury’s parents listened to a great deal of Indian music, and one of his early influences was the Bollywood playback singer, Lata Mangeshkar. According to Record Collector magazine, after moving to England, Mercury became a huge fan of Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles and Led Zeppelin. Mercury said of Hendrix: “Jimi Hendrix is very important. He’s my idol. He sort of epitomizes, from his presentation on stage, the whole works of a rock star. There’s no way you can compare him. You either have the magic or you don’t. There’s no way you can work up to it. There’s nobody who can take his place.” Another of Mercury’s favorite performers was singer and actress Liza Minnelli. In a 1975 interview, he says of Minnelli: “Liza, in terms of sheer talent, just oozes with it. She has sheer energy and stamina, which she gets across the stage, and the way she delivers herself to the public is a good influence. There is a lot to learn from her.”\n\nThe 1999 Millennium Poll, in which six hundred thousand Britons participated, he was voted into the number 14 and 15 spots as a popular musician and songwriter, respectively.  Mercury ranked at No. 58 in the 2002 list of \"100 Greatest Britons\", sponsored by the BBC and voted for by the public. Two of Mercury's songs, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and \"We Are The Champions\" have each been claimed, in separate polls, as the world's favourite song. Most recently, an Ericsson poll of six hundred thousand people in sixty-six different countries found \"We Are The Champions\" to be the world's most popular tune. This contradicts another major poll by Guinness World, which had previously found \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" to be the world's most popular song of the past 50 years.  The online music community at DigitalDreamDoor has consistently placed him at the number one position on a list of the 100 greatest rock vocalists.  In a list of the greatest English language singers of the 20th century, compiled by BBC Radio, he was the highest-ranked hard rock vocalist, having been voted at the tenth spot. He also came in second in MTV's list of the 22 greatest singers of the past 25 years.   In 2006, Time Asia magazine voted Mercury as one of the most influential Asians in the past 60 years.\n\nFreddie Mercury was of full Parsi descent, grew up in India, and moved to the UK when he was only 17. Consequently, he was arguably the world's first Indian rock star.\n\nA Royal Mail stamp called the Millennium Stamp commemorated the life of Freddie Mercury. The stamp caused controversy because Queen drummer Roger Taylor could be seen in the background. At that time, members of the British Royal family were the only living people who usually appeared on stamps in the UK, although this policy has since changed. (The tradition had been broken decades earlier, in 1967, with a stamp for Sir Francis Chichester who had sailed around the globe solo.)\n\nOn August 25, 2006, an organization calling itself the Islamic Mobilization and Propogation, or UAMSHO, petitioned the Zanzibar government's culture ministry, demanding that a large-scale celebration of what would have been Freddie Mercury's sixtieth birthday be canceled.  UAMSHO had several complaints about the planned celebrations, including that Mercury was not a Muslim, had a homosexual lifestyle that was not in accordance with the laws of Islam, was not a true Zanzibari, and that 'associating Mercury with Zanzibar degrades our island as a place of Islam.' The planned celebration was canceled.\n\nRock star David Bowie, who recorded the song \"Under Pressure\" with Queen and performed said song (together with the remaining members of Queen and Annie Lennox) at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, said of Mercury: \"Of all the more theatrical rock performers, Freddie took it further than the rest\". – \"He took it over the edge. And of course, I always admired a man who wears tights. I only saw him in concert once, and as they say, he was definitely a man who could hold an audience in the palm of his hand. He could always turn a cliche to his advantage.\"\n\nOpera singer Montserrat Caballé, who collaborated with Mercury on the Barcelona album said of him, “The difference between Freddie and almost all the other rock stars was he was selling the voice.” \nPop star Robbie Williams, who has performed with two of the remaining members of Queen, Brian May and Roger Taylor, was quoted as saying, “Freddie, if you’re out there and you want to choose any artist to channel your work, please give me an album, or at least a middle eight.”\n\nComedian Mike Myers, whose movie Wayne's World introduced \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" to a new generation of listeners, said of Mercury, \"He had theatricality, he was larger than life, new, fresh, cool. This is a god that walks as man.\" \n\nRock singer Rob Halford said of Mercury, \"I was deeply saddened when I heard Freddie passed away. A great performer, a great voice, a great musician was lost to the world. Thank God we have the music to listen to forever.\" \n\n\"I watched him, and I watched him die, and it was so painful for me, because I really loved Freddie Mercury, the way that he just truly went with his voice.\" Dave Mustaine of Megadeth. \n\nAlthough singer Axl Rose (of Guns N' Roses) has long been criticised by gay activists, he was apparently a devoted Freddie Mercury fan. He has been quoted as saying, \"If I didn’t have Freddie Mercury’s lyrics to hold on to as a kid, I don’t know where I would be. It taught me about all forms of music. It would open my mind. I never really had a bigger teacher in my whole life.\"[35] Rose also performed “We Will Rock You” and “Bohemian Rhapsody” with Elton John at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. \n\nFreddie Mercury was the one rock star mentioned in singer Kurt Cobain’s alleged suicide note (1994): \"I havent [sic] felt the excitement of listening to as well as creating music along with reading and writing for too many years now. I feel guilty beyond words about these things. For example, when we’re backstage and the lights go out and the manic roar of the crowds begins, it doesn't affect me the way in which it did for Freddy [sic] Mercury who seemed to love, relish in the love and adoration from the crowd, which is something I totally admire and envy.\"\n\nIn an interview with KROQ radio, singer Tori Amos claimed that she invoked the spirit of Freddie Mercury in order to write her 1992 song \"Sugar.\" As she explained, \"I was in Bath. This voice in my head, it sounded like Freddie, Freddie Mercury’s voice, and I was playing these chords, and I was thinking about this thing that made me write this song, and I just heard him go, 'Sugar, he brings me Sugar,' and I just went, 'Thanks, Freddie.'....\" <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Freddie+Mercury\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

In early 2021, she released Miss Anthropocene (Rave Edition), featuring remixes by BloodPop®, Modeselektor and Channel Tres.\n\nShe later returned with a run of standalone singles, including Player of Games (2021) and Shinigami Eyes (2022), previewing her long-teased project Book 1.\n\nIn 2023, Grimes released I Wanna Be Software, collaborated with Sevdaliza on Nothing Lasts Forever, and appeared on Anyma’s cinematic single Welcome to the Opera. The following year she returned on Anyma’s TARATATA, blending ethereal vocals with melodic techno influences.\n\nHer 2025 singles I D G A F and Artificial Angels mark the newest phase in her evolution — shimmering, high-definition explorations of post-human emotion, uniting her signature art-pop vision with futuristic electronica. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Grimes\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Idris Vicuña (born May 28, 1990), professionally recognized as Eyedress, is a Filipino solo musician. Raised in the Philippines, particularly an area he described as a \"ghetto,\" Eyedress began playing the guitar at a young age. He and his family moved to Phoenix, Arizona, where he was introduced to punk music. At age 13, he and his family moved to Orange County, California. There he joined the crust punk band Liberal Underground as a bassist. He moved back to the Philippines at age 15 with his family. \n\nAt age 20, he started composing music by making beats on his laptop and releasing them for free online. After gaining a small following from making beats, Eyedress was introduced to Filipino singer Skint Eastwood, and they collaborated on the song \"Biolumine\". The song earned him attention from a French label which pushed for him to make an album, which then earned him a record deal with Abeano Records, a subsidiary of XL Recordings. On December 2, 2013, he released his debut extended play Supernatural, which he recorded in his bedroom using FL Studio.\n\nEyedress released his debut mixtape, Hearing Colors, as a free digital download on April 11, 2014. He released his second EP, Egyptian Night Club to SoundCloud on July 27, 2014. In September 2014, he released the single \"Polo Tee\" as a tribute to American record producer DJ Rashad. He released his first mixtape after leaving XL Recordings, \"Shapeshifter\", in 2015.\n\nHe signed to Lex Records in 2016: releasing his debut studio album \"Manila Ice\" the following May. That was followed by \"Sensitive G\" in November 2018.\n\nEyedress relocated to Los Angeles from Manila and began recording new songs at his home in Silver Lake.\n\nIn late 2019 and early 2020, the first singles from Eyedress' third studio album Let's Skip to the Wedding were released. These included \"Jealous\" and \"Romantic Lover\" which became viral hits on TikTok. \"Jealous\" was certified gold in Australia, Canada, Poland and the USA in 2021, and platinum in the USA in March 2022. \"Romantic Lover\" was certified gold in the USA in April 2022. The album itself was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and \"Let's Skip to the Wedding\" was finally released on August 7, 2020.\n\nHis next album, Mulholland Drive, was released on August 27, 2021. In September 2021, shortly after the album release, the first single from Mulholland Drive, \"Something About You\" went viral in the US with Rolling Stone citing the track as the fastest-rising song on American streaming services for the week ending September 23. In January 2022, Eyedress was ranked at number 35 on the Billboard Emerging Artists chart. \"Something About You\" was certified gold in the USA in May 2022. The album was nominated for Libera Award for Marketing Genius.\n\nEyedress teamed up with Filipino American artist named Zzzahara and announced their debut album together as The Simps. The album, Siblings, was released by Lex Records on February 14, 2022. The tracklist includes \"Tesla,\" the album's first track as wells as the songs \"Miss Fortunate\" from 2019 and \"On Fye\" from 2020. The two related over their Filipino background and shared taste in music. Zzzahara soon started playing guitar in the group thereafter.\n\nIn April, 2022 Eyedress played Coachella festival with his new band debuting new material from his forthcoming album his fifth studio, Full Time Lover.[24] The album was released on August 26, 2022. It the track list consists of 28 tracks of hip-hop, post-punk and shoegaze. Shortly after the album, Eyedress released a cover of Blur's \"Song 2\" and he featured on Nosaj Thing track \"Different Life\" from the album Continua.\n\nOn October, 5 2022 an Eyedress remix of Fly Anakin, Pink Siifu & Fousheé's track \"L's\" was released. The next day Eyedress performed live at Elsehwere in Brooklyn headlining a Lex Records event which also included performances by Pink Siifu and Fly Anakin.\n\nA remix of Full Time Lover track \"House of Cards\" by Kevin Shields was released as part of the Lex-XX remix series on January 23, 2023. RCA Records released \"Flowers & Chocolate\", his first single for a major label with a music video directed by Eddie Huang on February 13.

        "biografia":"Beck Hansen (born Bek David Campbell, July 8, 1970) is an American musician, singer-songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist.  Beck's music is known for its pop-junk culture collage of musical styles, ironic lyrics, samples, drum machines, live instrumentation and heady sound effects.\n\nBeck was born in Los Angeles, California, to David Campbell (a musician and son of a Presbyterian minister) and Bibbe Hansen (a former dancer for The Velvet Underground, founding member of the satirical band Black Fag, and visual artist). When his parents separated, Beck stayed with his mother and brother in Los Angeles, where he was influenced by that city's diverse musical offerings—everything from hip-hop to latin music—and his mother's art scene – all of which would later reappear in his recorded and published work.\n\nAlthough Beck's work defies easy description, his eclecticism and genre experiments have sparked comparisons with Prince, though Beck was undoubtedly a less prolific artist, and drew on an absurdist, free-flowing lyrical style totally original when first exposed to mainstream audiences (indeed, some critics labeled him and his breakthrough single Loser as novelties - see below). Despite this individualism, Beck's music was very much a product of the 90s and the media age in general, with hip hop, alternative rock, electronic music, and genre-benders like the Beastie Boys as notable touchstones; in addition, some critics could not resist likening his head-spinning lyrical aesthetic to a post-modern Bob Dylan sensibility.\n\nAfter dropping out of high school in the mid-1980s, Beck educated himself and traveled widely. In Germany, he spent time with his grandfather, fluxus artist Al Hansen. His artistic relationship with his grandfather may have influenced both his album art and sense of musical collage. He began the musical activity in 1988. The late-80's found him in New York City as part of the punk-influenced anti-folk music movement.\n\nBeck returned to Los Angeles at the turn of the decade, destitute but motivated. During this time, Beck sought out (or snuck onto) stages at venues all over Los Angeles, from punk clubs to coffee shops. Some of his earliest and most thought-provoking recordings were achieved by working with Tom Grimley at Poop Alley Studios, a part of WIN Records.\n\nIn this atmosphere of heady creativity the founders of Bong Load Custom Records discovered Beck. Their 1993 12\" vinyl Loser, from an initial run of 530 copies, created a sensation on college and alternative radio that led to a furious bidding war between labels to sign Beck. Eventually, he chose Geffen Records, who offered him terms that included an allowance for the release of independent albums while under contract (he may have owed Bong Load another album or two).\n\nIn 1994, Geffen's official debut release of Mellow Gold made Beck a mainstream smash success; it also led to his iconic status as the \"slacker\" representative of the alternative rock scene, although the title of the song had been ironic.\n\nAt the same time, he released Stereopathetic Soulmanure on Flipside Records and One Foot in the Grave on independent K Records. Beck took his act on the road with the 1995 Lollapalooza tour. Still, some critics panned him as a one-hit wonder. Audiences' (especially at Lollapalooza) familiarity with Loser only, and their general disinterest in his other work only reinforced his image as a one-hit wonder.  It's been said said that Beck released Stereopathetic Soulmanure and One Foot in the Grave to shake the Gen X-ers that associated themselves with him and made \"Loser\" their slacker anthem.  \n\nThe one-hit wonder label was put to rest with the release of 1996's Odelay, a collaborative effort with The Dust Brothers, producers of Paul's Boutique. The lead single, \"Where It's At\", received heavy airplay and its video was in constant rotation on MTV. Within the year, Odelay had received perfect reviews in Rolling Stone and Spin magazines, having been listed on countless \"Best of\" lists (it topped the Pazz & Jop Critics Poll for 'Album of the Year'), receiving double-platinum status, and earning an impressive number of industry awards, including two Grammys.\n\nOdelay was followed in 1998 by Mutations. Produced by Nigel Godrich of Radiohead fame, it was intended as a stopgap measure before the next album proper. Recorded over two weeks, during which Beck recorded one song a day, the sessions produced 14 songs. Mutations was a departure from the electronic density of Odelay, and was filled with folk and blues influences. Songs on the album consisted of older tracks, some even dating back as far as 1994.\n\nIn 1999, Geffen released the much-anticipated Midnite Vultures, an orgy of sexual and culinary innuendo supported by a world tour. For Beck, it was a return to the high-energy performances that had been his trademark as far back as Lollapalooza. \n\nAfter Midnite Vultures came Sea Change in 2002, another airy and emotional album with producer Nigel Godrich, which became Beck's first U.S. Top 10 album, reaching # 8.  Sea Change was conceptualized as an album with one unifying theme—the stages following the end of a relationship. The album also featured string arrangements by Beck's father and a sonically dense mix reminiscient of Mutations. The Sea Change tour featured The Flaming Lips as Beck's opening and backing band.\n\nIn September 2003, Beck returned to the studio to work on his sixth major-label album. Guero was produced by the Dust Brothers and Tony Hoffer and features a collaboration with Jack White of The White Stripes; it marked a return to Odelay-era sound. The album was released in March of 2005 and despite critical acclaim, the album received a more lackluster response from Beck's alternative-oriented fanbase.\n\nBeck married Marissa Ribisi in April 2004, shortly before the birth of their son, Cosimo Henri Hansen.  2004 also saw the release of \"10 Years of Mellow Gold,\" a short documentary about Beck's first album.\n\nBeck's next album, The Information was released on October 3, 2006. It is a largely electronic and ambient, filled with blips and beeps. It was produced by Nigel Godrich, who worked on \"Sea Change\" and a longtime Radiohead and Thom Yorke producer. The first single was Nausea, an acoustic rock hip hop song. The next single was Cellphone's Dead, and the third single was Think I'm In Love.\n\nHis next single, Timebomb, was released on iTunes on August 21, 2007, and the limited edition vinyl 12\" was released on November 2, 2007, with an instrumental version of the song on the B-side. In December, 2007, it was announced that Timebomb had been nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance. \n\nModern Guilt was the eighth studio album by Beck. It was released on July 8, 2008. The album fulfilled Beck's recording contract with Interscope Records. Outside of North America, the record was released by XL Recordings. Its three singles were Chemtrails, Gamma Ray, and Youthless.\n\nModern Guilt features two contributions by Cat Power and was produced by Beck and Danger Mouse.\n\nThe album entered both the Billboard 200 and the Canadian Albums Chart at number four, and gave Beck his first ever Top 10 placing on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number nine. The album has also been Beck's best charting album in Australia, reaching 13. It sold 84,000 copies in its first week. Although successful, this does not match the first week sales of The Information, which were 99,000. In December 2008, Modern Guilt was nominated for Best Alternative Album at the 51st Grammy Awards.\n\nSong Reader, a project Beck released in December 2012, is 20 songs presented only as sheet music, in the hopes that enterprising musicians will record their own versions. The idea of Song Reader came about nearly fifteen years prior, shortly after the release of Odelay. When sent a book of transcribed sheet music for that album, Beck decided to play through it and grew interested in the world before recorded sound. He aimed to keep the arrangements as open as possible, to re-create the simplicity of the standards, and became preoccupied with creating only pieces that could fit within the Great American Songbook. In 2013 Beck began playing special Song Reader concerts with a variety of guests and announced he was working on a record of Song Reader material with other musicians as well as possibly a compilation of fan versions.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Beck was reported to be working on two new studio albums: one a more self-contained acoustic disc in the vein of One Foot in the Grave and another described as a \"proper follow-up\" to Modern Guilt. Beck expects to release both albums independently. He released two standalone singles over the course of the summer: the electro ballad Defriended and the chorus-heavy I Won't Be Long. A third single, Gimme, appeared on September 17.\n\nIn October 2013, it was announced that Beck signed to Capitol Records. Beck released his twelfth studio album entitled Morning Phase on 21 February 2014. For the recording of Morning Phase, Beck reunited with many of the same musicians with whom he had worked on the critically acclaimed 2002 album Sea Change. On January 20, 2014, the album's first single Blue Moon was released. Beck released the second single, Waking Light, on February 4, 2014.\n\n4 years later, on October 13th, 2017, Beck released the second album that was supposed to come out alongside Morning Phase. This album was called Colors. Colors is very different from Beck's previous albums, in which he takes a stab at pop music. Beck's expertise, mixing genres, works in this album when he mixes Alternative Rock, hip hop, and a lot of Pop. The album's earliest single, \"Dreams\", was released in June 2015, and three more (\"Wow\", \"Dear Life\", \"Up All Night\") were released between June 2016 and September 2017. The title track was released as a single in April 2018. The album won the Best Alternative Music Album and Best Engineered Album (Non-Classic) at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nAfter a short wait, Beck released Hyperspace on November 22, 2019. There was little marketing for this album. The whole album is a collaboration with Pharrell Williams, as he produced almost every song on the album. The album's first single was \"Saw Lightning\" released on April 15, 2019, and had a folk-pop sound to it. It doesn't fit with the rest of the album's synth lo-fi sound. Other singles were \"Hyperlife\" and \"Uneventful Days\" on October 17, 2019, and \"Dark Places\" on November 7, 2019.\n\nThere are multiple artists named Beck:\n\n1) Beck is an independent artist, singer, and multi-instrumentalist from Chiang Rai, Thailand. He first burst into the world of music at a young age while learning to play guitar in a local church. In order to pursue music full time, he moved to Bangkok. Currently he records with his brother, and his musical style is a blend of R&B, Pop, Soul, and Jazz influences.\n\n2) BECK can refer to a fictional rock band from the Japanese Anime series BECK: Mongolian Chop Squad. The fictional BECK's songs feature in the BECK Original Sound Track. BECK's style and members are highly influenced by various different artists. From vocals in the style of Zack De La Rocha from Rage Against the Machine, guitar influenced by Tom Morello of the same band, the band is highly influenced by rap-rock.\n\nAs the series develops, other influence appear, including guitar in the style of Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page, and Red Hot Chili Peppers John Frusciante. During the series, the band covers a famous The Beatles song, 'I've got a Feeling'. The name BECK could have possibly been influenced by the first artist Beck, mentioned above. Harold Sakushi, the original author of the series, has confirmed that BECK is generally based around the Red Hot Chili Peppers, being his favourite band. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Beck\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Their debut album as Local Natives, \"Gorilla Manor\", was released in the UK on November 2nd, 2009, and saw a US release date of February 16th, 2010. The band's sound has been described as \"afropop-influenced guitars with hyperactive drumming and hooky three-part harmonies\". They started to attract the attention of the music press after playing nine shows at the 2009 SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. Initial reviews of Local Natives have drawn favourable comparisons to Arcade Fire, Fleet Foxes and Vampire Weekend.\n\nUtilizing lots of vocal harmonies and drifting, dreamlike melodies, Local Natives have an intricate sound based around the delicate interconnectedness of all of their parts. This gives the band a sound that is able to be orchestral while still feeling understated, evoking the carefully assembled pop of Grizzly Bear. Their debut, Gorilla Manor, arrived in 2009 through U.K. label Infectious Records (with a domestic release coming by way of Frenchkiss in 2010). In 2011, Andy Hamm left Local Natives, leaving them to continue on as a quartet. In 2013, the band returned with its sophomore album, Hummingbird, featuring the single \"Breakers\".\n\nOfficial website: http:\/\/www.localnatives.com <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Local+Natives\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"X Ambassadors is an American alternative rock band hailing from Ithaca, New York. The band was formed in 2009 by brothers Sam and Casey Harris, and childhood friend Noah Feldshuh. Initially, the group started out playing local gigs and self-releasing music, but their unique sound soon caught the attention of record labels.\n\nThe band's music is an eclectic mix of genres, including alternative rock, indie rock, and pop. They are known for their energetic and emotional live performances, which are often accompanied by elaborate visuals and lighting.\n\nX Ambassadors' breakthrough came with the release of their debut album, \"VHS,\" in 2015. The album spawned several hit singles, including \"Renegades,\" \"Unsteady,\" and \"Jungle,\" which have collectively amassed over a billion streams on Spotify alone. \"VHS\" also featured collaborations with other artists, including Imagine Dragons and Jamie N Commons.\n\nOne of the band's defining characteristics is their willingness to address personal and social issues through their music. For instance, \"Unsteady\" is a poignant reflection on the Harris brothers' upbringing with a mother who battled substance abuse, while \"Renegades\" is a call for rebellion against societal norms.\n\nX Ambassadors have also been vocal advocates for mental health awareness and have worked with organizations like the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the JED Foundation. In 2019, they launched their own initiative, the \"Joyful Tour,\" which aimed to destigmatize mental health issues and promote self-care among fans.\n\nIn addition to their studio albums, X Ambassadors have released several EPs and singles over the years, showcasing their versatility as a band. They have also collaborated with other artists on various projects, including the soundtrack for the Netflix film \"Bright\" and the song \"Home\" with Machine Gun Kelly and Bebe Rexha. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/X+Ambassadors\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Kenny Wayne Shepherd and his group exploded on the scene in the mid-'90s and garnered huge amounts of radio airplay on commercial radio, which historically has not been a solid home for blues and blues-rock music, with the exception of Stevie Ray Vaughan in the mid-'80s. Shepherd was born June 12, 1977, in Shreveport, LA. The Shreveport native began playing at age seven, figuring out Muddy Waters licks from his father's record collection (he has never taken a formal lesson). At age 13, he was invited on-stage by New Orleans bluesman Brian Lee and held his own for several hours; thus proving himself, he decided on music as a career. He formed his own band, which featured lead vocalist Corey Sterling, gaining early exposure through club dates and, later, radio conventions. Shepherd's father\/manager used his own contacts and pizzazz in the record business to help land his son a major-label record deal with Irving Azoff's Giant Records. Ledbetter Heights, his first album, was released two years later in 1995. Ledbetter Heights was an immediate hit, selling over 500,000 by early 1996. Most blues records never achieve that level of commercial success, much less ones released by artists who are still in their teens. Although Shepherd -- who has been influenced by (and has sometimes played with) guitarists Stevie Ray Vaughan, Albert King, Slash, Robert Cray, and Duane Allman -- is definitely a performer who thrives in front of an audience, Ledbetter Heights is impressive for its range of styles: acoustic blues, rockin' blues, Texas blues, Louisiana blues. The only style that he doesn't tackle is Chicago blues, owing to Shepherd's home base smack dab in the middle of the Texas triangle. 1998's Trouble Is... earned a Grammy nomination; Live On followed a year later. In 2004 The Place You're In was released on Reprise Records, the first album that featured Shepherd doing the majority of the lead vocals (singer Noah Hunt handled the lead vocals on the previous two albums). Shepherd's next project saw him traveling in the American South with a documentary film crew and a portable recording studio as he backed up several veteran blues players on their home turf. The resulting album and film, 10 Days Out (Blues from the Backroads), appeared in 2007. \n\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/+noredirect\/Kenny+Wayne+Shepherd\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"There are at least two artists with the name Brian May.\n\n1) Brian Harold May was born on July 19, 1947, in Feltham, England. He is best known as the guitarist for the English rock band Queen. Within the band, he introduced multi-layered guitar harmonies, often performed on his custom-built guitar known as the \"Red Special.\" In 2002, he played \"God Save the Queen\" on the roof of Buckingham Palace during the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nMay has also released solo material, including the albums \"Back to the Light\" and \"Another World,\" and composed the soundtrack for the film \"Furia.\" He has collaborated with various artists, including Paul Rodgers, Ian Hunter, and Eddie Van Halen.\n\nIn addition to his music career, May is an astrophysicist. He earned a doctorate in astrophysics, completing a thesis he began in the 1970s prior to Queen's rise to fame. In 2006, he co-authored the book \"Bang! The Complete History of the Universe\" with Sir Patrick Moore and Chris Lintott, which has been translated into several languages.\n\nIn the 2000s, May toured with Queen & Paul Rodgers alongside fellow Queen member Roger Taylor. This collaboration resulted in three live albums: \"Return of the Champions\" (2005), \"Super Live in Japan\" (2006), and \"Live in Ukraine\" (2009), as well as the studio album \"The Cosmos Rocks\" (2008). The group later disbanded amicably, although future collaborations remain possible. In 2010, May was also involved in non-musical projects, including a potential film adaptation of the musical \"We Will Rock You.\"\n\n2) Brian May, born in Adelaide in 1934 and unrelated to Brian Harold May of Queen, was an Australian composer known for his work in film scores. He studied piano, violin, and conducting at the Elder Conservatorium in Adelaide. In 1957, he joined the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, where he founded the ABC Adelaide Big Band. He later moved to Melbourne in 1970 to lead the ABC’s Melbourne Show Band.\n\nMay became prominent in the Australian film industry during a period of growth in international recognition. He composed scores for several films, including \"Mad Max,\" \"The Road Warrior (Mad Max II),\" \"Race for the Yankee Zephyr,\" \"Road Games,\" \"Cloak and Dagger,\" \"Death Before Dishonor,\" \"Missing in Action 2,\" \"Sky Pirates,\" \"Steel Dawn,\" \"Dr. Giggles,\" \"Freddy’s Dead: The Final Nightmare,\" and \"Blindside.\" He won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Original Score for \"Mad Max\" and received other honors, including a Golden Award from the Australian Performing Rights Association.\n\nMay continued composing until 1993 and created music for more than 30 films and numerous television programs, often orchestrating his own work. He passed away in 1997 at the age of 63. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Brian+May\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Alcest (\/al.sɛst\/) is a French blackgaze act formed in Bagnols-sur-Cèze, Occitanie in 2000 by multi-instrumentalist Neige (Stéphane Paut).\n\nIt was originally conceived as a solo project, though it would eventually take on the form of a full band as Aegnor (now known as La Sale Famine de Valfunde) and Argoth, with whom Neige played in Peste Noire, joined the fray and released a four-track demo entitled Tristesse hivernale in 2001. This demo was a more straightforward black metal affair, much different from what would happen next. After that released, Alcest returned to a one-member format, with Neige moving away from the metal overtones of the three-piece and embracing a more atmospheric approach to his work.\n\nThe 2005 EP release, Le Secret, was more in tune with the project’s ultimate goal, which was to put to ear, as it were, Neige’s fascination with an “otherworld”—of sorts—that had held a fascination for him beginning in his childhood. In 2007, Neige released the first full-length Alcest recording, Souvenirs d'un autre monde, which was released on Prophecy Productions, and was a critical success. Écailles de lune, released in 2010, continues in the otherwordly vein, evoking images of an underwater realm. \n\nThe band’s third album, Les Voyages de l'âme, was released on January 6, 2012.\n\nAlcest’s fourth effort entitled Shelter was released on January 17, 2014 via Prophecy Productions. It features Birgir Jón Birgisson as producer, Amiina for the string sections and a guest appearance by Neil Halstead. This album is completely different to any previous Alcest works, and can be described as shoegaze\/dream pop.\n\nIn 2016 with Kodama, they’re back with their heavier sound, while taking on a concept about “the confrontation of the natural world and the human world”.\n\n2019 brings Spritual Instinct, released this time by Nuclear Blast Records. As Neige said, “It is a very cathartic record—something needed to get out of me. It’s darker than usual, and heavier.”\n\nᴍᴇᴍʙᴇʀs\nNeige (Stéphane Paut) — vocals, guitars, bass, keyboards (2000–present), drums (2000–2009)Winterhalter (Jean Deflandre) — drums (2009–present)Zero (Pierre Corson) — guitars, backing vocals (2010–present; live only) Indria Saray — bass (2010–present; live only)\n\nᴍᴀᴊᴏʀ ʀᴇʟᴇᴀsᴇs\nTristesse hivernale (demo EP, 2001, Drakkar Productions)Le Secret (EP, 2005, Drakkar Productions)Souvenirs d'un autre monde (LP, 2007, Prophecy Productions)Écailles de lune (LP, 2010, Prophecy Productions)Les Voyages de l'âme (LP, 2012, Prophecy Productions)Shelter (LP, 2014, Prophecy Productions)Kodama (LP, 2016, Prophecy Productions)Spiritual Instinct (LP, 2019, Nuclear Blast Records)Les Chants de l'aurore (LP, 2024, Nuclear Blast Records) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Alcest\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"The National is an American indie rock band formed in Brooklyn, New York in 1999, by friends from Cincinnati, Ohio. The band's lyrics are written and sung by Matt Berninger in a distinctive, deep baritone. The rest of the band is composed of two pairs of brothers: Aaron Dessner (guitar, bass, keyboards), Bryce Dessner (guitar), Scott Devendorf (bass, guitar) and Bryan Devendorf (drums). \n\nTheir self-titled debut album\"The National\" (Brassland 2001) was recorded and released before they had played even a single show. They cut the album with engineer Nick Lloyd and formed a label with writer Alec Bemis, so those recordings could be released. Kerrang! magazine gave it four Ks, calling it \"the stuff underground legends are made of.\"\n\nThe National made a second album, \"Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers\" (Brassland\/Talitres 2003). The staff was the same, though Peter Katis, who produced \"Turn on The Bright Lights\" and \"Antics\" by Interpol, helped produce and mix, and Australian composer Padma Newsome from Clogs collaborated on arrangements and strings.\n\nFollowing the first session of several for Bernard Lenoir on France's Radio Inter, an in-between EP was released, Cherry Tree, containing what would become the blueprint for the sound on their next record and the session of Sad Song's standout Murder Me Rachael. After these accolades and being impressed by their live show, Roger Trust signed them to Beggars Banquet.\n\nA show at their favorite bar became a van ride to neighboring cities, became a plane ride to Europe, became two summers overseas. Their ties to those good jobs slackened. And they continue on their own path, moving out even further out in Brooklyn to Ditmas Park, where there is space and familiar suburban streets and even Geese on Beverly Road. Their album, \"Alligator\", much of which was recorded at their homes in Ditmas Park, was engineered by Paul Mahajan, who has worked with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and TV on the Radio. Padma Newsome camped out for a month with the band, and Peter Katis added more production and mixed the record at his house in Bridgeport, Connecticut.\n\nBerninger's potent baritone still intones about matters fraught and funny and sad; about record collections, missing persons and medium-sized American hearts. But the record's not simply gothic or miserablist -- more like the plays of Tennessee Williams, it's full of peculiar intimacies and awkward grace. Alligator's heroes are reckless and possessed seducers, but they are apologetic ones. In The National's imaginings, in songs alternately lush and spare, there is something twighlit and dreamy worked out in the basement of our brains.\n\n\"Abel,\" \"Secret Meeting,\" and \"Lit Up\" were released as singles.\n\nOn May 22, 2007, The National released their follow-up to Alligator, Boxer, on Beggars Banquet. Taking advantage of the fact that nobody had heard their first album and earliest demos, Matt proceeded to steal lyrics and melodies from them and give them the attention they deserved while keeping the intimacy that made them special. They even managed to convince new friend Sufjan Stevens to lay down some piano tracks for them, and recorded the album in a scant 6 months after coming off the long post-Alligator road.\n\n\"Mistaken for Strangers\", \"Fake Empire\" and \"Apartment Story\" have been released as singles. The band have just finished touring North America and are on a large European autumn\/winter tour after playing high slots at several large festivals. In their Dec. 07\/Jan. 08 issue, Paste magazine named Boxer best record of 2007.\n\nThe band's fifth album, High Violet, was released on May 10, 2010 by 4AD Records. \"Bloodbuzz Ohio\", \"Anyone's Ghost\" and \"Terrible Love\" were released as singles.\n\nIn 2013 their sixth studio record Trouble Will Find Me was released and named \"Best New Music\" by Pitchfork. The album contained the single \"I Need My Girl\". In 2015, the album outtake \"Sunshine On My Back\"  was released.\n\nFour years after Trouble Will Find Me, marking the longest timespan between albums in their career so far, they released their seventh album Sleep Well Beast on September 8th, 2017 and were yet again met with great critical success.\n\nThe National homepage: http:\/\/www.americanmary.com\/\nThe National blog http:\/\/tntl.tumblr.com\nThe National on Twitter http:\/\/twitter.com\/TheNational\nThe National on Instagram http:\/\/instagram.com\/TheNational\nBrassland homepage: http:\/\/brassland.org\/\nBeggars Banquet homepage: http:\/\/www.beggars.com\/ <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+National\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The band has sold over 100 million records worldwide and achieved seven platinum or multi-platinum certifications, nine Top 10 albums on the Billboard 200 chart—including \"Dr. Feelgood\" (1989), their only studio album to reach number one—twenty-two Top 40 mainstream rock hits, and six Top 20 pop singles.\n\nMötley Crüe became known for their hedonistic lifestyles and androgynous image. Their first two albums, \"Too Fast for Love\" (1981) and \"Shout at the Devil\" (1983), established their hard rock and heavy metal sound, while their third release, \"Theatre of Pain\" (1985), marked their transition into glam metal. The band is also recognised for elaborate live performances featuring pyrotechnics, roller coaster drum kits, flame-throwing guitars, and theatrical stage effects. Their most recent studio album, \"Saints of Los Angeles,\" was released on June 24, 2008. What was initially intended as their final concert took place on December 31, 2015, and was later released in theatres and on Blu-ray in 2016.\n\nAfter a period of inactivity, Vince Neil announced in September 2018 that Mötley Crüe had reunited and was recording new material. On March 22, 2019, the band released four new songs as part of the soundtrack to their Netflix biopic \"The Dirt,\" which is based on their autobiography of the same name. The soundtrack reached number one on the iTunes All Genres Album Chart, number three on the Billboard Top Album and Digital Album Sales charts, number ten on the Billboard 200, and achieved top 10 positions internationally. The autobiography also re-entered The New York Times Best Seller list. In 2022, the band embarked on a co-headlining North American tour with Def Leppard, marking their first major tour in seven years.\n\nMötley Crüe has undergone several lineup changes, with Nikki Sixx remaining the only constant member. Vocalist John Corabi replaced Vince Neil from 1992 to 1996, while drummers Randy Castillo and Samantha Maloney filled in after Tommy Lee’s departure in 1999; Lee returned to the band in 2004.

        "biografia":"ZZ Top is a hard rock band formed in 1969 in Houston, Texas. For 51 years, it was composed of vocalist-guitarist Billy Gibbons, drummer Frank Beard and bassist-vocalist Dusty Hill, until Hill's death in 2021. ZZ Top had developed a signature sound based on Gibbons' blues guitar playing style and Hill and Beard's rhythm section. They are popular for their live performances, sly and humorous lyrics, and the matching appearances of Gibbons and Hill, who wore sunglasses, hats and long beards.\n\nZZ Top formed after Gibbons' previous band, Moving Sidewalks, disbanded in 1969. Within a year, they signed with London Records and released ZZ Top's First Album in 1971. Subsequent releases, such as Tres Hombres (1973) and Fandango! (1975), and the singles \"La Grange\" and \"Tush\", gained extensive radio airplay. By the mid-1970s, ZZ Top had become renowned in North America for their live act, including the Worldwide Texas Tour (1976–1977), which was a critical and commercial success.\n\nAfter a hiatus, ZZ Top returned in 1979 with a new musical direction and image, with Gibbons and Hill wearing sunglasses and matching chest-length beards. With the album El Loco (1981), they began to experiment with synthesizers and drum machines. They established a more mainstream sound and rose to international stardom with Eliminator (1983) and Afterburner (1985), which integrated influences from new wave, punk, and dance-rock. The popularity of these albums' music videos, including those for \"Gimme All Your Lovin'\", \"Sharp Dressed Man\", and \"Legs\", gave them mass exposure on television channel MTV and made them prominent artists in 1980s pop culture. The Afterburner tour set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour of 1986.\n\nAfter gaining additional acclaim with the release of their tenth album Recycler (1990), and its accompanying tour, the group's experimentation continued with mixed success on the albums Antenna (1994), Rhythmeen (1996), XXX (1999), and Mescalero (2003). They most recently released La Futura (2012) and Goin' 50 (2019), a compilation album commemorating the band's 50th anniversary. By the time of Hill's death in 2021, ZZ Top had become the longest-running band with an unchanged lineup in the history of popular music. Per Hill's wishes, he was replaced by their longtime guitar tech Elwood Francis on bass.\n\nZZ Top has released 15 studio albums and sold an estimated 50 million records worldwide. They have won three MTV Video Music Awards, and in 2004, the members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2015, Rolling Stone ranked Gibbons the 32nd greatest guitarist of all time. The band members have supported campaigns and charities including Childline, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and a fundraiser for the Delta Blues Museum.\n\nStudio albums\nZZ Top's First Album (1971)  \nRio Grande Mud (1972)  \nTres Hombres (1973)  \nFandango!

The band consists of Kelly Jones (lead vocals, lead guitar, keyboards), Richard Jones (bass guitar, harmonica, backing vocals), Adam Zindani (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Jamie Morrison (drums, percussion) and touring member Tony Kirkham (keyboards). The group previously included Stuart Cable (1992–2003) and then Javier Weyler (2004–2012) on drums. Stereophonics have released twelve studio albums, including eight UK number one albums. A successful compilation album, Decade in the Sun, was released in November 2008 and charted at number two on the UK Album Chart.\n\nDescribed as \"classic UK rock delivered with whisky vocals\", the band have been summarised as possessing a sound akin to the genres of alternative rock and \"British traditional rock\". Stereophonics' debut album, Word Gets Around, was released in August 1997 and charted at number six in the UK, aided by the singles \"Local Boy in the Photograph\", \"More Life in a Tramps Vest\" and \"A Thousand Trees\". The band reached mainstream success with the release of Performance and Cocktails (and its promotional singles \"The Bartender and the Thief\", \"Just Looking\" and \"Pick a Part That's New\") in 1999 and have achieved a total of ten top-ten singles as well as one number one: \"Dakota\" (2005).

        "biografia":"XYLØ is the alias of American singer-songwriter Paige Duddy (born August 8, 1994) . From 2015 to 2018, XYLØ was a musical duo that consisted of Paige Duddy and her brother Chase. Since 2018, Paige has embarked on a solo career and has continued to release her new music under the XYLØ moniker.\n\nRaised in a musical family, Paige fell in love with singing and writing her own lyrics at the influential age of 13. By the time she was 18, she had honed these skills and was collaborating with her older brother, Chase Duddy. In 2016, XYLØ released their debut EP, embarked on national tours, performed at countless festivals, accumulated millions of streams and earned a platinum plaque for their collaboration with The Chainsmokers on the song, “Setting Fires” (by The Chainsmokers featuring XYLØ). After the release of their successful single “I Still Wait For You” in 2017, XYLØ evolved into a whole new musical artist. Having grown up behind the mic, Paige found her own powerful voice; one that currently resonates worldwide - both sonically and lyrically. She and her brother mutually parted ways, allowing her to shine and him to pursue his own endeavors. \n\n2018 is a new chapter for XYLØ and an emergence for Paige as a solo artist. “I’ve spent the last 9 months discovering myself as a young woman and as a singer\/musician - with all the ups and downs that brings. The new music is about what I’ve gone through during this time, from living on my own for the first time, to facing the changing relationships in my life.\"\n\nFour EPs named pretty sad (2019), yes & no (2019), The Ganglands of My Heart (2020) and OUTSIDERS CLUB (2020) self-released by XYLØ under Pretty Records. The title track from \"yes & no\" is her most successful single on Spotify as an independent artist to date, with almost 15 million streams. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/XYL%C3%98\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

He achieved his first UK Top 10 single with \"The Road to Hell (Part 2)\", having already established a substantial following across mainland Europe.\n\nRea’s music frequently reflected personal themes and was, at various points, shaped by ongoing health problems. His best-known songs include \"I Can Hear Your Heartbeat\", \"Stainsby Girls\", \"Josephine\", \"On the Beach\", \"Let's Dance\", \"Driving Home for Christmas\", \"Working on It\", \"Tell Me There's a Heaven\", \"Auberge\", and \"Julia\". He also recorded the duet \"If You Were Me\" with Elton John. Rea received nominations for the Brit Award for British Male Solo Artist in 1988, 1989, and 1990.\n\nDespite his international success, Rea never toured the United States. There, he was primarily known for the single \"Fool (If You Think It's Over)\" (1978), which reached number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent three weeks at number one on the Adult Contemporary chart, leading to a Grammy Award nomination for Best New Artist. In the late 1980s, his song \"Working on It\" reached number one on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart.

        "biografia":"The Cranberries were an Irish rock band formed in Limerick in 1989. The group consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Dolores O’Riordan, guitarist Noel Hogan, bassist Mike Hogan, and drummer Fergal Lawler. O’Riordan joined the band in 1990, replacing founding member Niall Quinn, and the group’s name was shortened from The Cranberry Saw Us to The Cranberries following her arrival. Although primarily classified as an alternative rock band, their music incorporated elements of indie rock, jangle pop, dream pop, folk rock, post-punk, and pop rock.\n\nIn 1991, The Cranberries signed with Island Records and released their debut album, \"Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?\" (1993), which achieved commercial success. Their second album, \"No Need to Argue\" (1994), brought them international recognition and featured the hit single \"Zombie,\" which became one of their signature songs and an enduring protest anthem. The success continued with the albums \"To the Faithful Departed\" (1996) and \"Bury the Hatchet\" (1999).\n\nIn 2000, the band signed with MCA Records and released their fifth album, \"Wake Up and Smell the Coffee\" (2001). The album received a mixed commercial response, and the band expressed dissatisfaction with its promotion. After a six-year hiatus beginning in 2003, The Cranberries reunited in 2009 for a North American tour, followed by concerts in Latin America and Europe. Their sixth studio album, \"Roses,\" was released in 2012, marking their first new material in over a decade. In 2017, they released \"Something Else,\" an acoustic and orchestral reinterpretation of earlier songs.\n\nFollowing O’Riordan’s death in 2018 from drowning due to alcohol intoxication, the remaining members decided to disband after completing work on their final album, \"In the End\" (2019), which was released posthumously to critical acclaim.\n\nThe Cranberries were one of the best-selling alternative rock acts of the 1990s, with global album sales approaching 50 million as of 2019. The band received several major awards, including an Ivor Novello Award, a Juno Award, an MTV Europe Music Award, and a World Music Award, and they were nominated for both Brit and Grammy Awards. The music video for \"Zombie\" became the first by an Irish band to surpass one billion views on YouTube.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Cranberries\n\nStudio albums\nEverybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?

        "biografia":"Sheryl Suzanne Crow (born February 11, 1962) is an American blues rock singer, guitarist, bassist, pianist and songwriter. Her music blends country, pop, folk, and blues rock into one mainstream sound, and she has won nine Grammy Awards. Crow is also a noted political activist.\n\nCrow was born in Kennett, Missouri. Her parents were members of a local big band in which her father, an attorney, played trumpet. The family was very musical and owned three pianos.\n\nIn school, she was active in choir, athletics, and school plays. Even at a young age she was a perfectionist who strived to please her parents. In high school she was a drum majorette, member of the Pep Club, the National Honor Society, Future Farmers of America, Freshman Maid, Senior Maid and Paperdoll Queen. When her prom date was later questioned about her fame he said that at the time he thought she \"would be a doctor's wife someday\". She graduated in 1984 from the University of Missouri where she majored in music education with a concentration in piano. Coincidentally, actor Brad Pitt and ABC-TV news anchor Elizabeth Vargas were also students at the University of Missouri at the same time Crow was studying there; however, it is unknown whether or not any of these three future celebrities actually knew each other while they were students.\n\nFollowing college she became an elementary school music teacher in a suburb of St. Louis where she could be located closer to her fiance. Teaching during the day allowed her the opportunity to sing in bands on the weekends. Many people who knew her socially then, describe her as a nice, kind, elementary school teacher whose goal was settling down to raise children. At times, they acknowledge, she also struggled to get by on a teacher's salary. Other than comments about wanting to go to California someday and \"make it\", and her weekend band gigs, few during this period of her life saw the relentless determination that would someday carry her to multi-millionaire rock stardom. Or if they saw it, they didn't realize they were witnessing a future rock star in training. This time in her life, in retrospect, might accurately be considered by those who knew her then as her \"wilderness years.\"\n\nAfter a couple years of teaching and healing from a broken engagement, she was introduced to a local musician\/producer. He had a thriving studio in the basement of his parent's home and helped her by using her in advertising jingles. Her first jingle was a back-to-school spot for the St. Louis department store Famous-Barr. McDonald's and Toyota commercial jingles soon followed. She was recently quoted in her 60 Minutes segment as saying she made $50,000 on her McDonald's commercial alone. This success spurred her into thinking what she could possibly do if she went into music full time.\n\nMotivated by her new-found success, Crow decided to move to Los Angeles in 1986. Using her demo jingle tapes from St. Louis and perservering through constant rejections, she eventually found work as a backup vocalist for many major label acts. She was recruited to perform as a backup singer for Michael Jackson on his Bad tour. Whether she actually crashed the audition, as widely reported at the time, is uncertain. She spent the next 17 months touring the world singing back up and a duet, \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" on stage with Jackson. After the tour ended in 1989, she sang back up for Don Henley and in the following year made her first appearance on Saturday Night Live singing back up (\"time, time, take it, take it away\") for Henley. Later she credited Henley for helping her write better songs.\n\nIn 1989, she played keyboards in the touring version of Toy Matinee, which was led by her boyfriend at the time, Kevin Gilbert.\n\nBy 1990, Crow had attracted the attention of A&M Records, eventually leading to her debut album which remains unreleased but widely bootlegged to this day. However, she did not like the slick and well-produced pop sound of the record and implored the label to allow her to start anew. What followed was months of depression that was mentioned years later in People magazine where she stated she felt her career was over. She eventually teamed up professionally with producer Bill Bottrell.\n\nCrow became acquainted with a song writing collective known as \"The Tuesday Night Music Club\" through Bottrell, a member of the club; and dated another member, Kevin Gilbert. There has been much controversy surrounding the credit for Crow's album Tuesday Night Music Club. While Crow has publicly taken credit for much of the album, most notably on The Late Show with David Letterman, members of The Tuesday Night Music Club have disputed this. David Baerwald, a member of TNMC, stated that, ``Everybody was equal, except Sheryl. She wasn't one of us. We helped her make a record.\"[1] Crow later acrimoniously split with most of the musicians in the collective and only Bottrell was involved in her follow-up album. Gilbert wrote a number of memorably excoriating songs such as Leaving Miss Broadway with lines such as And I know that you believe each new invention of the truth and I saw you on my TV taking credit for my work \/ And I knew if I said anything that I would be the jerk \/ There's always some ex-boyfriend, some jealous has-been clown \/ Trying to muscle in the spotlight, trying to keep the lady down.\n\nGilbert also struck back at Crow by re-recording their song Strong Enough under the name Keta Men as a fey, Village People-like disco anthem that was featured on the Dance Across the Universe collection on Universal Records.\n\nThis creative period resulted in her debut album, called Tuesday Night Music Club. She appeared in the New Faces section of Rolling Stone the summer of 1993. The album featured many of the songs written by Crow and her friends, including the first single, Leaving Las Vegas. The album was slow to garner attention until All I Wanna Do became an unexpected smash radio hit in the spring of 1994. As she later stated in People Magazine, she found an old poetry book in a used book store in the L.A. area and used a poem as lyrics in the song. To her and Bottrell's credit, they tracked down the author (Wyn Cooper) and according to People magazine, he ended up being paid over $50,000 in royalties. The singles Run, Baby, Run and Strong Enough were also released. Crow received several Grammy awards in 1994: Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for All I Wanna Do; Record of the Year for All I Wanna Do; and Best New Artist. The album, which sold 7 million copies, was controversial in that there were disputes among the other Tuesday Night Music Club members about not being fairly credited for their contributions.\n\nIn 1996 Crow released her self-titled second album, which earned her the cover of Rolling Stone. The album was darker and grittier and far more political, with songs about abortion (Hard to Make A Stand), homelessness and nuclear war. The debut single If It Makes You Happy became a radio hit, and netted her two Grammy awards for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Rock Album. Other singles included A Change Would Do You Good, Home and Everyday is a Winding Road. She produced the album herself to quiet critics that had accused her of being a no-talent self promoter on her first album. This album was banned at Wal-Mart because Crow was critical of their policy of selling guns to minors in the track Love Is A Good Thing.\n\nIn 1997 Crow contributed the theme song to the James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies. The song of the same title was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Song Written Specifically For a Motion Picture or Television.\n\nIn 1998 Crow released a third album, called The Globe Sessions. She discussed in press interviews having gone through a deep depression, and had a highly publicized relationship with music legend Eric Clapton. The debut single from this album, My Favorite Mistake, was rumored to be about him, though Crow claims otherwise. The album won Best Rock Album at the 1998 Grammy Awards; it was re-released in 1999, with a bonus track, Crow's cover of the Guns N' Roses song Sweet Child O' Mine, which was included on the soundtrack of the film Big Daddy. This song won the 1999 Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. Other singles included \"There Goes the Neighborhood\", \"Anything But Down\" and \"The Difficult Kind\". \"There Goes the Neighborhood\" won a Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance in 2000 when it was included in her album, \"Sheryl Crow and Friends: Live from Central Park.\"\n\nIn 1999, Crow also made her acting debut as ill-fated drifter Laurie Bloom in the suspense\/drama The Minus Man, which starred her then-boyfriend Owen Wilson as a serial killer.\n\nShe also released a live album called Sheryl Crow and Friends: Live From Central Park. The record found Crow singing many of her hit singles with new musical spins and guest appearances by many other musicians including Stevie Nicks, the Dixie Chicks, and Eric Clapton.\n\nIn 2002, after a break and some touring, Crow released C'mon, C'mon. Musically unlike any of her other records, the project had a more pop feel. Videos and promotional photos also found Crow more scantily clad than ever before, in bikinis and hot pants. Crow stated she was making a statement that women over 40 were still sexy. Whether a statement or a marketing tool, C'mon, C'mon spawned hits in \"Soak Up the Sun\" and 2002 Best Female Rock Performance Grammy winner \"Steve McQueen\". Crow also performed the song \"Safe & Sound\" from this album at a television benefit for the victims of September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks and at the MTV Video Music Awards. 2002 also found Crow collaborating with Stevie Nicks, and releasing a successful single called \"Picture\" with rumored boyfriend Kid Rock that peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Later Crow said they were good friends.\n\nCrow opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, wearing a shirt that read \"I don't believe in your war, Mr. Bush!\" during a performance on Good Morning America and posting an open letter explaining her opposition on her website. Her public stance attracted so many supporters of the war to her website that the message board was closed for a number of days.\n\nIn 2003, Crow released a greatest hits compilation called The Very Best of Sheryl Crow. It featured many of her hit singles, as well as some new tracks. Among them was the ballad \"The First Cut is the Deepest\" (a song originally composed and performed by Cat Stevens), which became her biggest radio hit since her first, \"All I Wanna Do,\" which hit #2 in 1994. The single \"Light In Your Eyes\" was also released, but received limited airplay.\n\n2004 saw Crow appear as a musical theater performer in the Cole Porter biopic De-Lovely. Her performance within the film of the Porter classic \"Begin the Beguine\" was critically panned by film reviewers.\n\nCrow met cycling great Lance Armstrong at a cycling event in October of 2003. They began dating shortly thereafter and announced their engagement in September of 2005. Nearly five months later, however, they announced their surprise break-up in a joint statement issued on February 3, 2006: \"After much thought and consideration we have made a very tough decision to break up. We both have a deep love and respect for each other and we ask that everyone respect our privacy during this very difficult time.\" Previously, Crow denied a break-up, stating that \"when we were rumored to have split, and when our publicists called these magazines to say we haven't split, the magazines were all so disappointed because that's really what's selling, rooting for a couple and then they split. That's what sells the magazines.\"\n\nHer album Wildflower, which had a more slow paced feel than her previous albums, was released in September 2005. Although the album debuted at #2, it received mixed reviews and was not as commercially successful as hoped. In December 2005 the album was nominated for a Best Pop Vocal Album Grammy Award, while Sheryl Crow was nominated for a Best Female Pop Vocal Performance Grammy Award for the first single \"Good Is Good.\" The album got a new boost of life in 2006 when the second single was announced as \"Always on Your Side\", re-recorded with British musician Sting and sent off to radio, where it was quickly embraced at Adult Top 40.\n\nCrow was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer in late February 2006. Her doctors have stated that \"prognosis for a full recovery is excellent.\" [2]\n\nCrow's first concert since her cancer diagnosis was on May 18 in Orlando, Florida where she played to over 10,000 Information Technology professionals at the SAP Sapphire Convention. Her first public appearance was on June 12, when she performed at the Murat Theater in Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nCrow was a main stage act at Lilith Fair and has contributed many songs to movie soundtracks and special projects that were never made available elsewhere, among them: \"D'yer Maker\" (Encomium: Led Zeppelin Tribute), \"La Ci Darem la Mano\" from Don Giovanni (Pavarotti & Friends For War Child), and \"Resuscitation\" (The Faculty). In 2006, Crow contributed the opening track to the soundtrack for Disney\/Pixar's animated film Cars, \"Real Gone\".\n\nOfficial site:\nwww.sherylcrow.com <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Sheryl+Crow\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"David Lebón nació en Buenos Aires, Argentina el 5 de octubre de 1952. Su carrera musical está signada por los constantes cambios de bandas. Inició su relación con la música cuando, a los ocho años, debió partir hacia los Estados Unidos para tratarse un problema asmático. Su estadía en el país del norte coincidió con el boom de la «Beatlemanía» lo cual, como a la gran mayoría, influyó decisivamente en su futuro. Fue así que - cuando era todavía menor de edad, lo que no le permitía permanecer en los boliches rockeros - formó parte de pequeños grupos como The Alley Cats (donde tocaba la guitarra) y The Lords of London, a cargo allí de la batería.\n\nTras su regreso, a fines de la década de los '60, era habitué de «La Manzana», uno de los pocos boliches de rock que existían en Buenos Aires, regenteado por Billy Bond, el más polémico pionero del rock vernáculo. En ese sitio conoció a Pappo - otro «estable» del lugar, al igual que Nacho Smilari y Héctor Starc - quien en 1970 lo incorpora como bajista en la primera alineación de su grupo Pappo's Blues, conformada también por Black Amaya en batería y un fugaz paso del bajista Vitico. Esta primera formación de Pappo's Blues registró un disco en 1971, que tuvo un notorio éxito.\n\nSimultáneamente, y bajo el seudónimo de «Davies», Lebón participó - con Black Amaya - de la grabación del disco de La Pesada del Rock and Roll, junto al mencionado Billy Bond. Su necesidad de estar en actividad lo llevó a acompañar al cantante Carlos Bisso y luego partir a España, donde se volvió a encontrar con Pappo, con quien formó un fugaz grupo del que también participó Ciro Fogliatta. A fines de 1971 fue baterista de Color Humano, grupo liderado por Edelmiro Molinari. Junto a esta alineación grabó el álbum debut con seis temas para el sello Microfón, del que participaron numerosos invitados.\n\nEn 1972 Lebón dejó la agrupación y su puesto fue ocupado por Oscar Moro. Ese mismo año, David fue el bajista de Pescado Rabioso, grupo fundado por Luis Alberto Spinetta tras la experiencia Almendra. Esta banda, compuesta por Spinetta en guitarra y voz, Carlos Cutaia en teclados, Amaya en batería y Lebón en el bajo, editó un álbum titulado \"Desatormentándonos\". En 1973, la banda registró un disco doble, pero diversos inconvenientes de producción e internos derivaron en la separación de la banda.\n\nTambién en 1973, David Lebón grabó su primer álbum solista (\"David Lebón\") que contenía toda su fuerza rocanrolera. \"32 macetas\" - un tema que volvería a grabar años después -, \"Dos edificios dorados\" y \"Hombres de mala sangre\" son algunos de los temas que se destacan de este disco compuesto a dúo con Liliana Lagardé. En esa misma época colaboraba casi constantemente tocando la guitarra en Sui Generis y los teclados en el grupo sinfónico Espíritu.\n\nFormó su propio conjunto en 1974 (Lila), un grupo de características devocionales; participó en al segunda grabación de \"La Biblia\", el legendario disco de Vox Dei, y ese año regresó a Pappo's Blues y La Pesada. Casi sobre el final de 1975 creó Polifemo, una banda de rock and roll puro, con Juan Rodríguez en la batería y Rinaldo Rafanelli al comando del bajo, ambos provenientes de Sui Generis. En el '76, tras la presentación de su disco \"Polifemo\", la crítica especializada fue muy dura con ellos, lo que marcó su decadencia. «Salí de Polifemo con la intención de no armar ningún grupo, con ganas de viajar - admitía David en una entrevista de la revista Pelo, allá por el '78 -, antes de que Charly me propusiera que lo hiciéramos juntos. Con el único tipo de Polifemo con en el que seguía comprendiéndome (...) era Juan Rodríguez. El me preguntó qué iba a hacer y a mí me dieron ganas de seguir tocando. A la vez, estaba con dos tipos que eran de la misión, que me gustaba cómo tocaban. Tocamos en algunos recitales y (...) la gente se volvía loca porque había salido de algo que era el haber dejado de tocar para mí.» (Leyendas, No 7).\n\nCon esta, su nueva agrupación, David empezó a crecer como músico pues, como él mismo lo reconocía, le «...empezó a gustar escuchar los demás instrumentos, incluso dejar que toquen». Junto a Rodríguez, los músicos de la misión y varios invitados (Pino Marrone, Aníbal Kerpel, entre otros), David Lebón formó Seleste. Esta agrupación, de buenas perspectivas, quedó momentáneamente interrumpida cuando David se unió en Brasil a Charly García en el proyecto Serú Girán. Entre 1978 y 1982 integró Serú Girán, junto a Charly García, Pedro Aznar y Oscar Moro, en donde fue distinguido como \"Mejor Guitarrista\" los cinco años consecutivos. Si bien siempre cumplió un papel secundario detrás de la figura arrolladora de Charly García, es en \"Bicicleta\" (1980) donde más se destaca su labor como compositor y vocalista.\n\nEn 1980 se lanzó \"Nayla\", el segundo disco de David Lebón como solista. Este álbum, que tuvo muchas postergaciones debido al accidente de la hija de David, iba a ser en principio un disco doble, pero ninguna compañía se lo aceptaba. «Ni siquiera Yes graba discos dobles», le llegaron a decir. No le quedó otra opción, entonces, que seleccionar los mejores temas - algunos nuevos, otros de su antigua agrupación Seleste - y grabarlo con Aznar, Moro, Raffanelli, Diego Rapoport y Ricardo Roth.\n\nCon Serú Girán ya separado, su producción como solista fue incrementándose, con una seguidilla de long plays. Estos son: \"El tiempo es veloz\" (1982), donde se rescatan el tema homónimo y \"No confíes en tu Suerte\"; \"Siempre Estaré\" (1983), - con temas exitosos como \"El rock de los Chicos Malos\" y \"Quiero Regalarte mi Amor\" -; \"Desnuque\" (1984), un homenaje al rocanrol del cual sobresalen \"Qué te pasa Argentina\", \"32 macetas\" y \"Hacelo hoy Conmigo\"; \"Y si de Algo Sirve\" (1985) y \"7 x 7\" (1986).\n\nEn 1987 colabora con Charly en su LP \"Parte de la Religión\", donde grabó unos solos de guitarra. Ya en 1989, define su placa \"Contactos\", grabado ese año, como «un encuentro personal entre mente, cuerpo y alma para así lograr el equilibrio que mejore mi relación con el mundo, las personas y mi Creador».\n\nA fines de 1992 fue el reencuentro de Serú Girán. Editaron un disco en estudios y dos en vivo. Realizaron una exitosa gira (más por la cantidad de público que por la calidad musical) y se disolvieron definitivamente. Lebón tuvo dos años de silencio musical, que lo tuvieron presente en las revistas del corazón por sus idas y venidas con la ex modelo Pata Villanueva. En el '95 retornó a los escenarios, primero con el Tributo a Carlos Gardel organizado por la Secretaría de Cultura y el Multimedios América y, luego, acompañado por Daniel Castro (bajo) y Daniel Colombres (batería), realizó una recorrida por toda su extensa trayectoria. Ese año se radicó en la provincia de Mendoza.\n\nEn 1999 se presentó en el Teatro Coliseo de Capital, para repasar los temas más importantes de su carrera acompañado por una joven banda con músicos de Divididos, la Mississippi, los Ratones Paranoicos y los Caballeros de la Quema, una sección de bronces y otra de brass. El show quedó registrado en el álbum \"En vivo en el Teatro Coliseo\". En el 2002 editó \"Yo lo soñé\".\n\nSu estilo de tocar la guitarra es netamente blusero y rocanrolero, con marcadas influencias de B.B.King. David Lebón se autodefine como un músico no profesional, en ambos sentidos: como un músico no contaminado por el show-business, pero a la vez indisciplinado e intuitivo en la creación. El suyo es un caso extraño. Su personalidad ha sido eclipsada por otras más fuertes, léase Pappo, Spinetta o Charly. A lo largo de su carrera integró muchos grupos, y lo hizo tocando los cuatro instrumentos base: guitarra, teclados, bajo y batería, aunque siempre se lo haya destacado por su sentimiento para tocar la guitarra eléctrica.\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/David+Leb%C3%B3n\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The band consists of Cody Carson (lead vocals, guitar), Zach Dewall (guitar, bass, vocals) and Maxx Danziger (drums), initially gaining a large audience through vocalist Cody Carson's YouTube Channel.

        "biografia":"Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers was a rock band formed in 1976 from Gainesville, Florida, USA and led by Tom Petty.\n\nPetty was supported by his band, The Heartbreakers, for the majority of his career. He has occasionally released solo work, as was the case with his 2006 album Highway Companion on which he performed most of the backing instrumentation himself. However, members of The Heartbreakers have played on each of his solo albums and the band has always backed him when touring in support of those albums.\n\nAfter the Petty's previous band Mudcrutch disbanded, Petty, never one to give up, enlisted Mudcrutch members Tench (keyboards) and Mike Campbell (guitar), along with Gainesville musicians Ron Blair (bass) and Stan Lynch (drums) to form the now famous lineup that was dubbed Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. They released their first album, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers in November 1976. In 2006, the band celebrated the 30th anniversary of that release.\n\nThis lineup stayed intact for four records and was responsible for some of the most infectious songs (\"American Girl\", \"Breakdown\", \"Listen To Her Heart\", \"Refugee\", \"I Need To Know\", \"Don't Do Me Like That\") and one of the most critically acclaimed albums (\"Damn the Torpedoes\") of all time. Their tremendous success catapulted them from club band to arena rockers seemingly overnight.\n\nBassist Blair split the band in 1982 and was replaced by Howie Epstein, a protege of seminal rocker Del Shannon. Epstein's solid playing and soaring backing vocals further complemented the band's live attack. Without missing a beat, they headed back into the studio to record a string of successful albums, including the classic \"Long After Dark\". In 1994, Stan Lynch left the Heartbreakers to pursue other musical challenges and Steve Ferrone (well regarded for his work with the Average White Band and Eric Clapton) soon became the Heartbreakers' chosen drummer.\n\nMost recently, at a time when many of their contemporaries have long since grown complacent, Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers have in 2002 released one of their finest and most controversial efforts - featuring some of Petty's most moving songs. Recorded both before and following the group's 2002 induction into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame, \"The Last DJ\", reflected Petty's strong views about the state of the music business and the culture generally. With the departure of Howie Epstein, \"The Last DJ\" marked another notable return: after two decades away, founding Heartbreaker Ron Blair returned to the band's rhythm section.  In 2010, The Heartbreakers released the well received album \"Mojo\". \n\nPetty died on 2 October 2017 following a cardiac episode earlier that day at his home in Malibu, California. Although some media outlets incorrectly reported his death following an erroneous police report, his death was confirmed later that day by his publicist and manager. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Tom+Petty+and+The+Heartbreakers\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Born Robert Edward Rosa Suarez on June 27, 1969, Long Island, New York. As \"Robby Rosa\" he was a member of Menudo from Valentine's Day, 1984 to 1987. He replaced Johnny Lozada in Menudo and soon became another fan favorite. He sang such hits like Tu Sabes A Chocolate, Hold Me and Like A Cannonball, which was featured in Hollywood hit Cannonball Run 2. He was replaced in Menudo by Ruben Gomez after the band's manager denied Rosa the opportunity to contribute songs to the group. However, Rosa quits at 16 before reaching the age of 18 which tipically marked the retiring age for members of the boy-band.\n\nAfter Menudo, Rosa went on to star in a minor Hollywood hit, the 1988 movie Salsa. On the set, Rosa fell in love with his co-star Angela Alvarado. They wed a few months after the movie's release, started raising a family and have also been working as partners in Rosa's different projects ever since.\n\nIn 1990 Rosa moved to Los Angeles and formed a rock band called \"Maggie's Dream\" which released an album under Capitol Records. In the early 1990's Rosa legally changed his name to \"Draco Cornelius Rosa\" (draco means \"dragon\" in Latin) saying he wanted to leave his old image and lifestyle behind. During this time, he released two albums which differ greatly from each other. The first one, Frío was released in 1994 and featured a pop sound along with soft rock influences. His second major work, Vagabundo, was released in 1996 and marked a drastic change from the previous album and image. Under the name Draco, Rosa created a heavy and dark album that carried elements of goth, psychedelia, and heavy metal. Vagabundo is considered one of the greatest Rock en Español albums of all time.\n\nDuring this time Rosa began collaborating with former Menudo colleague Ricky Martin, co-writing many of Martin's biggest hits, among them \"Livin' La Vida Loca\", \"She Bangs\", \"Maria\" and \"The Cup of Life\". He and co-writer Desmond Child earned Grammy nominatios for their work with Martin.\n\nIn 1998 he released his first english-language album, titled Songbirds and Roosters. It featured the english versions of the tracks from his debut album Frío. In 2001 Rosa released a Greatest Hits album called Libertad del Alma which featured songs from an upcoming album in which he had been working for more than three years.\n\nIn 2003, Draco again re-invented himself yet again, in preparation for the release of his most ambitious project yet, an album titled Mad Love Released in March 2004, the album contained tragic love themes in different musical genres ranging from hard rock to flamenco ballads. The album was comprised of 15 songs, 3 of which are sung in Spanish. The album was the first to earn Rosa international recognition beyond Latin America, becoming widely popular in Europe. Rosa toured the continent with Lenny Kravitz in the summer of 2004.\n\nRosa received a Latin Grammy Award in 2004 for the video clip of the song \"Más y Más\". In September 2004, Draco took his show to Puerto Rico's new 18,000-capacity Coliseo de Puerto Rico, selling out the venue. A CD\/DVD of the event was released on December 6, 2005, titled DRACO Al Natural. He capped 2005 with 7 sold out concerts at Puerto Rico's \"Bellas Artes\" theatre in the month of September and proceeded to focus on a new spanish-language album for 2007.\n\nRosa currently lives in Los Angeles with his wife Angela and two sons, Revel and Redamo, although he also has a residence in Puerto Rico. Rosa has been known for using many different pseudonyms when writing songs for other artists. Among them are \"Dolores del Infante\", \"Ian Blake\" and \"Phantom Vox\". On December 19, 2005 multi-artist Celso Gonzalez introduced an instalation called \"El Ultimo Viaje: El Entierro de Robi Rosa\" (\"The Final Voyage: The Burial of Robi Rosa\") at Puerto Rico's Museo de Arte Contemporaneo, by which the artist let the name \"Robi\" go. He is now known as Draco Cornelius Rosa. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/+noredirect\/Draco+Rosa\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Conor Oberst is an American singer-songwriter born February 15, 1980 in Omaha, Nebraska. He began his recording career in 1993 at the age of 13 and has since produced an enormous amount of material. Conor was deeply influenced early on by singer-songwriters David Dondero and Simon Joyner.  His first two albums \"Water\" and \"Here's to Special Treatment\" were both released in 1994. Rolling Stone referred to him as \"rock's boy genius.\" His project Bright Eyes, with Mike Mogis and Nate Walcott, produced several critically-acclaimed records. Oberst also serves as the frontman to Desaparecidos (a punk-oriented side project). In August 2008, Oberst released his eponymous solo album, recorded with the Mystic Valley Band (Taylor Hollingsworth, Macey Taylor, Jason Boesel, Nik Freitas, and Nate Walcott), on Merge Records. Together, Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band went on to release 2009's Outer South. Oberst remains a prolific songwriter, releasing Upside Down Mountain in 2014, Ruminations in 2016, and Salutations in 2017. In 2019, Oberst collaborated with Phoebe Bridgers to release a record under the name Better Oblivion Community Center.\n\nAt fourteen years of age, Oberst became singer and guitarist of Commander Venus, an indie rock band. The former members of Commander Venus, Tim Kasher of Cursive, Robb Nansel (who now runs Saddle Creek), and Todd Fink of The Faint, would later go on to feature in many Saddle Creek recording groups. Conor was also a member of the band Park Ave, which he joined after terminating the difficult relationship he had with Megan Saienni, due to an affair with Maria Pantin.\n\nOberst was also guitarist and singer for the band Desaparecidos. The music and lyrics of Desaparecidos differ greatly from Bright Eyes, having more in common with punk rock than folk. The lyrics are generally social and political commentary on the state of affairs in America, the pitfalls of the suburban lifestyle, and America's love of capitalism as opposed to the more introspective lyrics of Bright Eyes.\n\nOberst is one of the founding members of the independent record label Saddle Creek Records, which hosts and has hosted bands including Cursive, Desaparecidos, The Faint, Rilo Kiley (who left to start their own label Brute\/Beaute Records), Bright Eyes, Son Ambulance, Azure Ray, The Good Life, and Sorry About Dresden, among others.\n\nOberst is currently involved in a boycott of Clear Channel Communications. His broadcast television performances include a spot on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in March 2005, which sparked controversy with his performance of the incendiary \"When the President Talks to God\", The Late Show with David Letterman, on which he performed \"The Trees Get Wheeled Away\", and his guitar-smashing performance of \"Road to Joy\" on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson.\n\nOberst was a member of the Vote for Change tour in 2004 with Bruce Springsteen and REM. He has recently started his own label, Team Love, which is currently hosting bands such as Tilly and the Wall, M. Ward, Jenny Lewis and The Watson Twins, A Weather, Capgun Coup, and David Dondero.\n\nBands:\nCommander Venus from 1995-97\nThe Magnetas in 1996\nPark Ave. from 1996-98\nDesaparecidos from 2001-2\nBright Eyes since 1995\nConor Oberst and The Mystic Valley Band since New Year's Weekend 2007\nMonsters of Folk since 2009\nBetter Oblivion Community Center since 2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Conor+Oberst\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Ozzy Osbourne (born John Michael Osbourne in Marston Green, Warwickshire, on 3 December 1948; died 22 July 2025) was an English singer, songwriter, and media personality remembered as the lead vocalist of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath, during which period he adopted the nickname \"Prince of Darkness\". On 5 July 2025, Osbourne performed his final show at the \"Back to the Beginning\" concert event. \n\nHe was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Black Sabbath in 2006 and as a solo artist in 2024.

The band was highly influential on the development of heavy metal music, in particular their critically acclaimed releases Paranoid, Master of Reality and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. Osbourne was fired from Black Sabbath in 1979 due to alcohol and drug problems, but went on to have a successful solo career, releasing 13 studio albums, the first seven of which received multi-platinum certifications in the US. Osbourne has since reunited with Black Sabbath on several occasions. He rejoined in 1997 and helped record the group's final studio album, 13 (2013), before they embarked on a farewell tour that ended with a February 2017 performance in their hometown, Birmingham. His longevity and success have earned him the informal title \"Godfather of Metal\".\n\nOsbourne's total album sales from his years in Black Sabbath, combined with his solo work, are over 100 million. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Black Sabbath and into the UK Music Hall of Fame as a solo artist and as a member of the band. He has been honoured with stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Birmingham Walk of Stars. At the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards, he received the Global Icon Award.

He co-starred with Jack and Kelly in the television series Ozzy & Jack's World Detour. The show's third season debuted in June 2018. \n\nOn 5 July 2025, Osbourne performed his final show at the Back to the Beginning concert event amid ongoing health battles. \n\nOsbourne passed away on 22 July 2025, seventeen days after his farewell show with Black Sabbath.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ozzy_Osbourne\n\nStudio albums\nBlizzard of Ozz (1980)\nDiary of a Madman (1981)\nBark at the Moon (1983)\nThe Ultimate Sin (1986)\nNo Rest for the Wicked (1988)\nNo More Tears (1991)\nOzzmosis (1995)\nDown to Earth (2001)\nUnder Cover (2005)\nBlack Rain (2007)\nScream (2010)\nOrdinary Man (2020)\nPatient Number 9 (2022) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Ozzy+Osbourne\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Sublime with Rome is a collaboration between Eric Wilson and Bud Gaugh of Sublime and Rome Ramirez. Vocalist and guitarist Rome Ramirez joined Wilson and Gaugh to perform classic material and eventually originals. It became clear that Ramirez could not replace Sublime's late lead singer and guitarist, Bradley Nowell, who died in 1996. The answer was to call the band \"Sublime With Rome\" instead of \"Sublime\", to clarify the difference.\n\nSublime with Rome performed their first gig together in February 2009 near Gaugh's home in Nevada, followed by an appearance at Cypress Hill's Smokeout Festival in San Bernadino that October. On April 20, 2010, the band embarked on their first-ever US tour with dates going into that fall. After positive reaction on the road, Sublime with Rome released a debut album on Fueled By Ramen records in July 2011. \n\nIn December 2011, Bud Gaugh revealed in an interview that he would be leaving Sublime With Rome and KROQ's Accoustic Christmas would be his last show. He saying he wanted to go home and spend more time with his family.  He later went on to say  \"It was really good for the first few months, after that, it just felt wrong. Not playing the songs but playing them with the name Sublime, without Brad.\" When asked if he saw the band reuniting in the future Gaugh replied \"No, I am done with SWR. I would be into playing music with Eric Wilson, however.\" He was replaced by Josh Freese.\n\nIn 2015, Sublime With Rome would release their second album \"Sirens\" featuring a collaboration with Dirty Heads on the title track.\n\nIn 2017, Carlos Verdugo known for drumming with The Tribal Seeds replaced Josh Freese. Later on, in 2023, Jason Vick briefly filled the spot until Joe Tomino was dubbed Carlos' official replacement.\n\nIn 2019, Sublime With Rome released their third album \"Blessings\", featuring singles like Wicked Heart and Blackout. This was a good year for the band - they performed with Post Malone at one point during 2019 and released a special cover of his song \"Goodbyes\".\n\nOn February 26, 2024, Eric Wilson announced that he was no longer a member of Sublime with Rome. The month after, the band announced The Farewell Tour and plans to release their final album.\n\nThe final, self-titled Sublime With Rome album featuring the final single 'Love Is Dangerous' along with the 4 tracks included on the Tangerine Skies EP as well as 5 new songs released on May 10th, 2024. The band will disband after The Farewell Tour ends. Rome has announced plans to release solo music in the near future, and Eric Wilson along with Bud Gaugh will be performing with Jakob Nowell as Sublime for the foreseeable future. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Sublime+with+Rome\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

They have released six studio albums.\n\n\"The Night Flight Orchestra\" started like so many others as an innocent yet serious drunken idea when Björn Strid (Soilwork) and David Andersson (Mean Streak, session Soilwork) were on the road together somewhere in North America in 2007. Björn and David were bonding over what they considered \"classic\" or not, from rock n roll conspiracies to being arrested in a lobby with nothing but leather pants on. All those scenarios, fictional or real, needed a soundtrack. They also came to think that whether you're on a metal tour or not, a lot of classic rock songs say it all and can really lend you a helping hand and make you forget about everything, especially when in motion or travelling. The classic escape. The never-ending road trip. The transatlantic night flight. It may sound simple and naive but what it all comes down to is that we all need that soundtrack to feel extra special, whether you have been arrested in a lobby or not. It didn't take long before bass player Sharlee D' Angelo (Arch Enemy, Spiritual Beggars) joined forces as well as keyboard player Richard Larsson (Von Benzo) and drummer Jonas Källsbäck (Mean Streak). The goal was to reclaim the 70's\/early 80's sense for classic melody, the forgotten recipe to a timeless song, preferably a song mentioning a city, street name or an exhilarating alcoholic beverage. Anything that will have you spitting out the word 'classic'. From \"Tarot Woman\" to \"Badlands\", from \"Rhiannon\" to \"Running on Empty\", from \"Blind Man\" to \"Night Moves\", from \"Deuce\" to \"Separate Ways\", from \"Elected\" to \"Set me Free\". The list goes on. It's all about reclaiming the \"classic\".\n\nStudio albums\n\nInternal Affairs (2012)\nSkyline Whispers (2015)\nAmber Galactic (2017)\nSometimes the World Ain't Enough (2018)\nAeromantic (2020)\nAeromantic II (2021)\nGive Us the Moon (2025) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Night+Flight+Orchestra\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Nevertel was formed in 2013 by Raul Lopez, Jeremy Michael, and Alec Davis. Though the three of them were all in different parts of the country, they all shared the same goal. With Raul in Boston, and Jeremy and Alec in two different locations of Florida, a challenge had presented itself. Together they worked on digitally assembling over 50 songs and they eventually cut it down to the 10 songs on Living Fiction.\n\nLater that year Raul returned to Florida and the trio spent hundreds of hours in Raul’s studio (Isolation Studios) trying to get the best sound and recordings possible. Once the album was complete, the trio faced a different challenge. So in 2015 they enlisted the help of, Kyler Worley, a longtime friend of the band. All of this is just the beginning of things to come from Nevertel.\n\nThe band's lineup consists of Alec Davis (Guitar), Jeremy Michael (Vocals), Raul Lopez (Vocals, Guitar) and Kyler Worley (Bass). To date, Nevertel has released two singles Rebound (2015) and Paranoid (2016). On April 5, 2016, Nevertel will release their first album called Living Fiction. On November 3, 2016 released their next single Blind World.\n\ntaken by: http:\/\/www.nevertelband.com\/ <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Nevertel\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"R.E.M. was an American alternative rock band from Athens, Georgia, formed in 1980 by drummer Bill Berry, guitarist  Peter Buck, bassist\/backing vocalist  Mike Mills, and lead vocalist  Michael Stipe. One of the first alternative rock bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality and obscure lyrics, Mills's melodic bass lines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical style of drumming. \n\nR.E.M. released their first single—\"Radio Free Europe\"—in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single \"The One I Love\". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.\n\nBy the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to enter the mainstream, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre. The band released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound and catapulted it to international fame. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound, but still continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members.\n\nIn 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. Its 1996 release, New Adventures in Hi-Fi, though critically acclaimed, fared worse commercially than its predecessors. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Stipe, Buck, and Mills continued the group as a trio. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success, despite having sold more than 85 million records worldwide and becoming one of the world's best-selling music artists. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in their first year of eligibility. R.E.M. disbanded amicably in September 2011, announcing the split on its website. \n\nIn January 1980, Michael Stipe met Peter Buck in Wuxtry Records, the Athens record store where Buck worked. The pair discovered that they shared similar tastes in music, particularly in punk rock and protopunk artists like Patti Smith, Television, and the Velvet Underground. Stipe said, \"It turns out that I was buying all the records that [Buck] was saving for himself.\" Through mutual friend Kathleen O'Brien, Stipe and Buck then met fellow University of Georgia students Mike Mills and Bill Berry, who had played music together since high school and lived together in Georgia. The quartet agreed to collaborate on several songs; Stipe later commented that \"there was never any grand plan behind any of it\". Their still-unnamed band spent a few months rehearsing in a deconsecrated Episcopal church in Athens, and played its first show on April 5, 1980, supporting the Side Effects at O'Brien's birthday party held in the same church, performing a mix of originals and 1960s and 1970s covers. After considering Twisted Kites, Cans of Piss, and Negro Eyes, the band settled on \"R.E.M.\" (which is an initialism for rapid eye movement, the dream stage of sleep), which Stipe selected at random from a dictionary.\n\nThe band members eventually dropped out of school to focus on their developing group. They found a manager in Jefferson Holt, a record store clerk who was so impressed by an R.E.M. performance in his hometown of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that he moved to Athens. R.E.M.'s success was almost immediate in Athens and surrounding areas; the band drew progressively larger crowds for shows, which caused some resentment in the Athens music scene. Over the next year and a half, R.E.M. toured throughout the Southern United States. Touring was arduous because a touring circuit for alternative rock bands did not then exist. The group toured in an old blue van driven by Holt, and lived on a food allowance of $2 each per day.\n\nR.E.M. was pivotal in the creation and development of the alternative rock genre. AllMusic stated, \"R.E.M. mark the point when post-punk turned into alternative rock.\" In the early 1980s, the musical style of R.E.M. stood in contrast to the post-punk and new wave genres that had preceded it. Music journalist Simon Reynolds noted that the post-punk movement of the late 1970s and early 1980s \"had taken whole swaths of music off the menu\", particularly that of the 1960s, and that \"After postpunk's demystification and New Pop's schematics, it felt liberating to listen to music rooted in mystical awe and blissed-out surrender.\" Reynolds declared R.E.M., a band that recalled the music of the 1960s with its \"plangent guitar chimes and folk-styled vocals\" and who \"wistfully and abstractly conjured visions and new frontiers for America\", one of \"the two most important alt-rock bands of the day.\" With the release of Murmur, R.E.M. had the most impact musically and commercially of the developing alternative genre's early groups, leaving in its wake a number of jangle pop followers.\n\nR.E.M.'s early breakthrough success served as an inspiration for other alternative bands. Spin referred to the \"R.E.M. model\"—career decisions that R.E.M. made which set guidelines for other underground artists to follow in their own careers. Spin's Charles Aaron wrote that by 1985, \"They'd shown how far an underground, punk-inspired rock band could go within the industry without whoring out its artistic integrity in any obvious way. They'd figured out how to buy in, not sellout-in other words, they'd achieved the American Bohemian Dream.\" Steve Wynn of Dream Syndicate said, \"They invented a whole new ballgame for all of the other bands to follow whether it was Sonic Youth or the Replacements or Nirvana or Butthole Surfers. R.E.M. staked the claim. Musically, the bands did different things, but R.E.M. was first to show us you can be big and still be cool.\" Biographer David Buckley stated that between 1991 and 1994, a period that saw the band sell an estimated 30 million albums, R.E.M. \"asserted themselves as rivals to U2 for the title of biggest rock band in the world.\" Over the course of its career, the band has sold over 85 million records worldwide.\n\nAlternative bands such as Nirvana, Pavement, Radiohead, Coldplay, Pearl Jam (the band's vocalist Eddie Vedder inducted R.E.M. into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame), and Live, have drawn inspiration from R.E.M.'s music. \"When I was 15 years old in Richmond, Virginia, they were a very important part of my life,\" Pavement's Bob Nastanovich said, \"as they were for all the members of our band.\" Pavement's contribution to the No Alternative compilation (1993) was \"Unseen Power of the Picket Fence\", a song about R.E.M.'s early days. Local H, according to the band's Twitter account, created their name by combining two R.E.M. songs: \"Oddfellows Local 151\" and \"Swan Swan H\". Kurt Cobain of Nirvana was a fan of R.E.M., and had unfulfilled plans to collaborate on a musical project with Stipe. Cobain told Rolling Stone in an interview earlier that year, \"I don’t know how that band does what they do. God, they’re the greatest. They've dealt with their success like saints, and they keep delivering great music.\"\n\nDuring his show at the 40 Watt Club in October 2018, Johnny Marr said: \"As a British musician coming out of the indie scene in the early '80s, which I definitely am and am proud to have been, I can't miss this opportunity to acknowledge and pay my respects and honor the guys who put this town on the map for us in England. I'm talking about my comrades in guitar music, R.E.M. The Smiths really respected R.E.M. We had to keep an eye on what those guys were up to. It's an interesting thing for me, as a British musician, and all those guys as British musicians, to come to this place and play for you guys, knowing that it's the roots of Mike Mills and Bill Berry and Michael Stipe and my good friend Peter Buck.\"\n\n2) R.E.M. was an early elektro italo-disco act from Florence formed by Paolo Alfani & Nicola Serena. They experimented for the first time in 1983 with the use of a modified Speak & Spell electronic toy by Mattel for their vocal parts instead of the classic vocoder. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/R.E.M.\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

One of the things she brought home for me was a flyer for a Chicago Bears exhibition game that said: \"Come see American Football, featuring the most overpaid athletes in the world.\" Something about that statement made me think of rock bands, most of whom are the most overpaid musicians in the world.

        "biografia":"The Radio Dept. is a Swedish dream pop band formed in Lund, Sweden in 1995. Originally signed to Labrador Records and now release under their own label, Just So!. They have released four full length albums, and a series of singles and EPs. The band originated in Malmö, Sweden.\n\nIn 1995, The Radio Dept. was formed by Elin Almered and Johan Duncanson (who were old school friends). The name was taken from a gas station\/radio repair shop in Lund, Sweden, which had a large sign with the name Radioavdelningen, (\"The Radio Department\" in Swedish) hanging outside their shop.\n\nSince 1995 members have been coming and going and at some points there has never really been a Radio Department at all.\nMartin Carlberg and Johan Duncanson started playing together in 1998 and decided to use the name The Radio Dept. Since then the band has done lots of gigs and lots of recordings. The Radio Dept. recorded 4-tracks in friends' living rooms or at home, in smelly warehouse, in demo studios with blinking fluorescent lightning and at schools.\n\nIn the autumn of 2001 Lisa Carlberg and Per Blomgren (Bass & drums respectively), joined the band and they started rehearsing in the way bands so often do. Soon afterwards they were all joined by Daniel Tjader on the keyboards. Their recordings were sent to the music magazine Sonic and got a nice review. They were also on the free CD sampler that comes with the magazine. That's where Labrador Records discovered and learned to love the band. Now they're a part of Swedish indie label, Comings and goings\n\nOriginal band member, Elin Almered, left the band before the recording of The Radio Dept.'s debut (lesser matters), but still made an appearance singing vocals for \"Strange Things Will Happen\".\n\nPer Blomgren, Drummer, left the band before the release of Lesser Matters. The band opted instead for digital assistance with regards to drums & percussions for their songs.\n\nLisa Carlberg, bassist, departed from the Radio Dept soon after the release of \"This past week EP\". The band no longer felt the need for a member that solely specialized in bass. The band was taking a new direction and preparing for their second album, \"Pet Grief\", which wouldn't require a member that played bass guitar.\n\nThe current line up of the band is:\nJohan Duncanson (Guitar & Vocals), Martin Carlberg(Guitar) and Daniel Tjäder (Keyboards & Synth) (2006).\n\n\n\nMore details can be found on the radio dept. website: theradiodept.com.\n\n\nRecord Labels.\n\nSlottet:\nCreated in 2001, this is the Radio Dept's original label. Created & managed by the band themselves. They published and distributed their own recordings in order to spread their music to the world.\nThe \"Against The Tide EP\" & coveted \"Annie Laurie EP\" were both released on this label in 2002.\nAt sporadic moments over the years, whenever the band have wanted to release something quickly or for free, they'd do so through the Slottet label (e.g. bachelor Kisses in 2008).\n\nLabrador :\nAfter the success of the self released records and some glittering reviews in local publications, several major labels came calling. The Radio Dept. rejected most of these offers and instead signed with Labrador records. Although the band don't consider themselves connected ideologically or musically with Labrador and the other bands on the label, they have much respect for the label which has officially become the home of The Radio Dept.\n\nShelflife records:\nShelflife are an american indie label that operate on a similar philosophy to that of Sarah Records. They select highly innovative, creative & melodic bands and offer them transatlantic distribution. Several labrador bands had achieved success through shelflife, so it seemed an obvious choice to use them again for the distribution of 'Lesser Matters'. No futher Radio Dept records were released through shelflife.\n\nRex records:\nRex records was an London based experimental indie label started by an ex-XL employee. The aim was to release demos and promote leftfield indie music. Only two Radio Dept. records were released on Rex, Why Won't You Talk About It and the rare Liebling 7\".\n\nXL  Recordings:\nDuring 2004\/05, XL funded, distributed and promoted The Radio Dept.\nDuring this short partnership 4 records were released. Lesser Matters, Where Damage Isn't Already Done, Why Won't You Talk About It? and Ewan. A short european tour was organised for the band as well as lots of press and an appearance on an XL compilation with the likes of Ratatat & MIA.\n\n\nTrack & Field  Records:\nTrack & Field are another London based record label that took a chance on The Radio Dept.\nIn 2006 Track & Field were employed to distribute Pet Grief in the UK. They also promoted the band and planned for an extensive UK tour. This plan was abandoned and a series of special one-off London shows were organised to supplant the tour.\n\nPony Canyon:\nAfter years as an experienced distributor of DVD's & kids toys, Pony Canyon, tried their hand at promoting & distributing indie records. So far they've only distributed a special edition of Pet Grief in Japan.\n\n\nSoundtrack\nThree tracks by the Radio Dept. have been featured on the Sophia Coppola's film Marie Antoinette (2006). They are: Pulling our Weight, Keen on Boys, I Don't Like It Like This. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Radio+Dept.\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Comprised of Campbell Burns, Jake Johnson, Nate Delizzotti and Joseph Van Lier. The pleasant sounds of the four piece  have earned them love at home and across the sea. Their music could be faithfully summarised as vibes, fitting somewhere in the shoeboxes of indie rock and glistening psych-pop. Their latest release (appropriately titled Vibes) features the tuneful croons of the singer Campbell Burns between shining, chorus-heavy guitars, bobbing bass and brushy jazz-rock drumming (worth a listen for fans of Morrissey and\/or Mac Demarco). The band have just released a single that is the first taste of an album to come in 2018. \n\nBandcamp | Facebook\n\n2. Members from Chin Up Chin Up formed a new band\n\nVacations was conceived while Bobby, Greg & Jeremy were wandering around Europe somewhere, on tour with their old band Chin Up Chin Up. They decided it’d be fun to try to start a new band without any guitar. The group they came up with is damn near the realization of that dream. They’re not completely devoid of or anti-guitar, but it certainly isn’t the heart of the matter anymore like it’s been for most of their musical lives. Ukulele, kalimba and karimba (those are both types of African thumb pianos – I just found that out from Wikipedia, too, it’s okay) are the sonic bread and butter for a band that has no real place on the map globally. \n\nIn all honesty, Vacations is the sound of three guys making music who just don’t give a fuck anymore, and I mean that in the best of all possible ways. These three have spent years busting their asses trying to make it in music with their old bands (Chin Up, Make Believe, White Savage, Love of Everything, Hertzsprung Gap…) and making it just got old. Let’s face it. If it didn’t get old, they’d get pathetic. But letting go and quitting are two very different things. Vacations started as a way for the members to make music for themselves and leave the rat race (yes, I said it – the rat race of indie music. Trust me. It exists.) behind. They’ve brought back the whole reason they started making music in the first place: to make fun for themselves, their friends and hopefully their friends’ friends all over the place. It’s good-natured, revelry-inspiring, bizarro camaraderie in song. \n\nYou can feel it from the first warm and plaintive notes of “I Was Bikini.” It’s something that instantly feels nostalgic and wistful for a good time you can’t even remember having anymore, but you’re pretty sure is still lingering in your bones or your blood-stream somewhere. It’s a feeling found in most of Vacations’ songs, propelled by familiar melodies made out of seemingly unidentifiable timbres and a winded heartbeat of rhythms. And when Jeremy and Chicago’s favorite chanteuse Jeanine O’Toole (of the 1900s) tell you that they’ll “see you on the other side,” you’re so wrapped up by the song that you don’t even question it. \n\nVacations make a sound that, amidst all the buzzwords and hype-machines, serves to remind you that music is the ultimate meme. It is what you make it and how you choose to let people hear it. So staying true to what it once inherently meant to be an independent band, Vacations decided to forego what is now the obvious band routine. The pattern of “make an album, make someone put it out and make it sell” is not for them. They’ve retreated to the DIY-roots that abound in the songs they’re creating, but haven’t left the present tense behind. They brought it all back home. \n\nTheir debut album is being released on Bobby’s own label, Record Label, instead of searching, shaking hands and hoping someone else will call it theirs. Yeah, I know. Nothing new. Greg Ginn and Ian MacKaye did it thirty years ago. That doesn’t make it any less admirable, though, especially in today’s oversaturated and over-funded transparency of a music scene. The real crazy and inspiring thing is, that their maiden voyage, I Was Bikini \/ But Rain Afraid, isn’t even really an album by any stretch of the contemporary terms.\n\nLike I was saying earlier, I Was Bikini \/ But Rain Afraid is living in the present. An analog\/digital choose-your-own adventure if you will. The vinyl enthusiasts can get their fix via the I Was Bikini 7”, a format that our economy’s coming dangerously close to making extinct despite the general vinyl renaissance. Yet, the best part is if you want the tangible, the time constraints of the disc don’t come into play anymore. Not only does the 7” come with a code to download the five songs on the record, but it also unlocks the album’s other eight songs housed on But Rain Afraid. Vacations aren’t vinyl elitists, though, nor are they classists. The whole of the album, all thirteen songs, will be made available from the band’s own web home for a pay-what-you-want-just-pay-something price. I know this is a lot to digest, but honestly, what could be better? You get to decide what Vacations’ music is worth to you and what it looks like. No questions asked.\n\nIn the end, this is open-endedness enables what the guys in Vacations really want. They want to engage you. They want you to listen to the story they’re spinning in notes and words. They want to make you part of the music they’re making and the fun they’re having. They’re getting back to the roots they never knew and they want to meet you somewhere in the middle of the expanse for the hang of a lifetime.  - Jesse Woghin\n\n3. \"Vacations is the solo endeavor of Fungi Girls’ frontman, Jacob Bruce.

        "biografia":"Whirr is an American shoegaze band from San Francisco, California, United States. They formed in 2010, originally as Whirl. The name was created by the original drummer, Sergio Miranda, in the midst of recording the band's first demos as a nameless project. It was a homage to all the bands of \"the Scene That Celebrates Itself” (Lush, Ride, Moose, Medicine, Lilys, etc.). They had to legally change the name after a woman performing acoustic covers of Black Sabbath songs trademarked \"Whirl\" and threatened a lawsuit.\n\nWhirr's sound is often compared to My Bloody Valentine and Slowdive. Founding guitarist Nick Bassett also played in the band Deafheaven surrounding and including the release of their 2011 album, Roads to Judah.\n\nAfter a self-released demo cassette and the Distressor EP, the band signed to Tee Pee Records in 2011. The original vocalist Byanca Munoz left the band because of creative differences, and was soon replaced by Alexandra Morte (Night School, Camera Shy). They released the June single that year, followed by their 2012 debut album Pipe Dreams. The band also released two splits in 2012 with Anne and Monster Movie.\n\nIn 2013, the original drummer Sergio Miranda left the band and was replaced by Devin Nunes. Former vocalist Alexandra Morte also left the band and was replaced by Kristina Esfandiari (Miserable, King Woman). The band released a live EP entitled Part Time Punks Sessions on April 20, 2013. It was a performance recorded in 2012 that featured the band’s previous lineup.\n\nWhirr released the Around EP on July 9, 2013, featuring the new vocalist along with session drummer Trevor DeSchryver (Lycus, Dispirit, formerly Deafheaven). They toured to support it that August with the band Nothing. Esfandiari was fired from the band prior to the tour, leaving the band without a female vocalist for the first time.\n\nAs a result of touring together, members of Nothing and Whirr formed a gothic rock \/ post-punk side project called Death of Lovers. Nick Bassett then joined Nothing as a bassist, and has been touring with them ever since. He also started an alternative pop project with former Whirr vocalist Alexandra Morte called Camera Shy.\n\nWhirr released their cover of Nirvana's Pennyroyal Tea on the tribute compilation In Utero, In Tribute, In Entirety on April 19, 2014.\n\nThe second full-length LP entitled Sway was released on September 23, 2014. It's the first release with Loren Rivera as the sole vocalist for the band. \n\nOn October 7th, Graveface Records released a remastered version of their debut album entitled Pipe Dreams (Redux). The reissue is remastered by Jack Shirley and includes new artwork and the originally-intended tracklisting that the band preferred over the 2012 release. \n\nA Whirr \/ Nothing split was released November 17th, 2014 on Run for Cover Records.\n\nOn October 19th, 2015, a series of derogatory remarks towards G.L.O.S.S., a Washington-based hardcore punk band, were posted on Whirr's Twitter account. These tweets were considered as transphobic, and received massive backlash on social media. Graveface Records and Run for Cover Records severed ties with the band. Nick Bassett later admitted to posting the first tweet toward G.L.O.S.S., which read \"Lol @ G.L.O.S.S.\" after hearing about a rumor that the band was only permitting certain types of people to attend their shows and buy their merchandise. According to Nick, the other tweets were posted by a friend of Whirr and did not reflect the band's views in any way. Whirr posted a public apology to their twitter account, which said that they have severed ties with the person responsible for those tweets.\n\nOn the 25th of October 2019, after 3 years of being silent, Whirr did a suprise release on their website, announcing their new album Feels Like You by releasing a limited vinyl. The album leaked a couple days later, which made Whirr release the album on their bandcamp page.\n\nFour years after the release of  Feels Like You, on February 14th 2023, Whirr released their new single Muta \/ Blue Sugar\n\nRaw Blue  released on December 25th 2024 on Whirr's bandcamp page, in addition after the release of the album Whirr released two extra tracks from the album with their single Speeding \/ Busy\n\nListen, buy, and support:\nWhirr \/ Nothing split\nPipe Dreams (Redux)\nSway LP\nAround EP\nFeels Like You\nMuta \/ Blue Sugar\nRaw Blue\nSpeeding \/ Busy\n\nLinks:\nWhirr Bandcamp\nWhirr Tumblr\nWhirr Twitter\nWhirr Facebook\n\nCurrent Members:\nNick Bassett - guitar (2010-present)\nLoren Rivera - vocals, guitar (2010-present)\nJoseph Bautista - guitar (2010-present)\nEddie Salgado - bass (2010-present)\nDevin Nunes - drums (2013-present)\n\nPrevious Members:\nByanca Munoz - vocals, keyboards (2010-2011)\nSergio Miranda - drums (2010-2013)\nAlexandra Morte - vocals, keyboards (2011-2013)\nKristina Esfandiari - vocals (2013)\n\nDiscography:\nDemo (demo, 2010)\nDistressor (EP, 2011)\nJune (single, 2011)\nPipe Dreams (LP, 2012)\nWhirr \/ Anne (split with Anne, 2012)\nColor Change \/ Flatlining (split with Monster Movie, 2012)\nPart Time Punks Sessions (live EP, 2013)\nAround (EP, 2013)\nIn Utero, in Tribute, in Entirety (Pennyroyal Tea cover, 2014)\nSway (LP, 2014)\nPipe Dreams (Redux) (Remastered LP, 2014)\nWhirr \/ Nothing (split with Nothing, 2014)\nFeels Like You (LP, 2019)\nMuta \/ Blue Sugar (single, 2023)\nRaw Blue (LP, 2024)\nSpeeding \/ Busy (single, 2024)\n\n2.

Se costearon tambien una salida de cassettes y un distribuidor de la zona se ofreció a venderlas. Una cassette cayó en manos de Alfonso Corral, propietario de una pequeña discográfica independiente. Corría el año 1994 cuando salió su primer disco, \"Lágrimas de Amor\".\n\nSorprendidos por el éxito alcanzado, lanzan en 1995 su segundo trabajo: \"Sueños inalcanzables\", manteniendose durante treinta semanas entre los cincuenta discos más vendidos. En 1996, con más de 120 conciertos por toda España y numerosas apariciones en televisión y radio, Camela preparó un nuevo disco y para ello escogieron doce temas de aquellas maquetas que hicieron en sus comienzos y las mezclaron con nuevos instrumentos para ofrecer a sus fans \"Sus 12 Primeras Canciones\".\n\nEn 1997, \"Corazón indomable\" fue su nuevo trabajo que consiguió, por primera vez en la historia del grupo, situarse en el número uno de los discos más vendidos, llegando incluso a dejar atrás a artistas de renombre nacional e internacional.\n\nEn 1998, \"Camela Dance\", volvió a batir records: a la semana de su salida, consiguieron el reconocimiento de doble disco de platino. En 1999, el grupo había fichado por la multinacional EMI y su anterior casa discográfica editó \"No puedo estar él\", cuya principal novedad era \"Niña enamorada\", primer tema compuesto integramente por Dioni.\n\nEn 2000, formando parte ya de la discográfica EMI, sacaron \"Simplemente amor\", un disco \"nuevo\", con el que vuelven a batir récords de ventas y a ser los número uno durante varias semanas.\n\nEn mayo de 2001, viajan hasta Sudamérica para promocionar el disco en Chile. El momento cumbre de su visita al país fue durante la actuación promocional que dieron en el Paseo de la Ahumada ante 20.000 personas. A finales de septiembre de ese mismo año, el grupo publica \"Amor.com\", un trabajo que supera las 400.000 copias para sumar un total de cuatro millones de discos vendidos a lo largo de su carrera, motivo por el cual les fue entregado el disco de diamante.\n\nEn 2003 ofrecieron un nuevo álbum, el noveno de su historial y el tercero editado con EMI Hispavox, titulado \"Por siempre tú y yo\", con nuevas canciones compuestas por Dioni, Ángeles y Miguel Ángel.\n\nPara el 2004 el grupo vuelve a ser noticia con \"10 de Corazón\", doce temas nuevamente compuestos por Dioni y Angeles con el que celebran sus diez años de carrera discográfica. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Camela\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Rammstein is a German Neue Deutsche Härte band formed in Berlin in 1994. The group’s lineup—consisting of Till Lindemann (lead vocals), Richard Kruspe (lead guitar), Paul Landers (rhythm guitar), Oliver Riedel (bass), Christoph Schneider (drums), and Christian \"Flake\" Lorenz (keyboards)—has remained unchanged throughout their career. Their songwriting process typically involves Lindemann composing and performing lyrics to instrumental arrangements written by the rest of the band. Several members had previously played in punk rock groups such as Feeling B and First Arsch before forming Rammstein.\n\nAfter winning a local competition, Rammstein recorded demos and signed with Motor Music. Working with producer Jacob Hellner, they released their debut album \"Herzeleid\" in 1995. Although initial sales were modest, the band gained recognition for their energetic live shows, and the album later reached number six on the German charts. Their second album, \"Sehnsucht\" (1997), debuted at number one in Germany and produced the hit singles \"Engel\" and \"Du hast.\" The success of the album led to an extensive international tour lasting nearly four years and the release of the live album \"Live aus Berlin\" (1999).\n\nAfter signing with Universal Music, Rammstein released \"Mutter\" in 2001, which yielded six singles, all charting across Europe. The lead single, \"Sonne,\" reached number two in Germany. Their next album, \"Reise, Reise\" (2004), featured the successful singles \"Mein Teil\" and \"Amerika,\" both peaking at number two in Germany; \"Mein Teil\" also became the band’s first number-one single in Spain. The band followed with \"Rosenrot\" (2005), whose lead single \"Benzin\" reached number six in Germany, and the live album \"Völkerball\" (2006).\n\nTheir sixth studio album, \"Liebe ist für alle da\" (2009), included the single \"Pussy,\" which became their first number-one hit in Germany, partly due to its controversial explicit music video. Following this release, the band took an extended break from recording while continuing to tour and issue compilations and live albums, including \"Made in Germany,\" \"Rammstein in Amerika,\" and \"Paris.\" In 2019, Rammstein returned with the single \"Deutschland,\" which became their second number-one song in Germany. Their untitled seventh studio album, released the same year, topped charts in 14 countries. During the COVID-19 lockdowns, the band wrote and recorded their eighth studio album, \"Zeit,\" released in 2022.\n\nRammstein were among the first bands associated with the Neue Deutsche Härte genre, a term coined by the music press following the release of \"Herzeleid.\" Their work has generally been well received by critics, and they have achieved significant commercial success, with multiple number-one albums and numerous gold and platinum certifications worldwide. The band is widely recognized for their elaborate live performances featuring extensive pyrotechnics. Despite their popularity, Rammstein have faced controversy over their provocative imagery and lyrical themes. The song \"Ich tu dir weh\" led to \"Liebe ist für alle da\" being temporarily placed on the German Federal Review Board for Media Harmful to Minors index due to its explicit content, prompting a re-release of the album without the track.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rammstein\n\nStudio albums\nHerzeleid (1995)\nSehnsucht (1997)\nMutter (2001)\nReise, Reise (2004)\nRosenrot (2005)\nLiebe ist für alle da (2009)\nRammstein (2019)\nZeit (2022) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Rammstein\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Amaral is a Spanish group, from the city of Zaragoza, made up of Eva Amaral - vocals and composer - and Juan Aguirre - guitarist and composer. The group's name is Eva's surname. Their music is pop and rock, with poetic lyrics about feelings. Eva's voice is deep, strong and very melodious.\n\nBiography:\n\n1993-2000: The group Amaral was created on January 1st 1997 with Eva Amaral, main vocalist and composer, and Juan Aguirre, guitarist and composer, as members. The name of the group is Eva's surname, and it was chosen by Juan.\n\nTheir story started at the beginning of the 90's, when Eva and Juan met at a recording studio in the city of Zaragoza. At the time, Eva was playing with a group called Bandera Blanca (White Flag) and Juan, with his group Días de vino y rosas (Days of Wine and Roses) collaborated with Eva's on one song. A close relationship was immediately born between them. In 1997 they moved from Zaragoza to Madrid and signed with EMI\/Virgin. On May 5th 1998, they released their eponymous first album, Amaral, produced by Pancho Varona. They sold around 70,000 copies, in a country with 40 million inhabitants.\n\n2000-2002 \nIn the year 2000, after a tour to present their first album, Amaral went to London to record their second album, called Una pequeña parte del mundo (A Little Part of the World), produced by Cameron Jenkins. It was a more mature record which contained 13 songs. Twelve of them were composed by the group and the thirteenth one was a version of a song by the Spanish singer Cecilia.\n\n2002-2004\nTwo years later, Amaral entered the studio again with the same producer and recorded their third album, called Estrella de mar (Starfish). It was named Best National Album in 2002. They won several awards that year, including an MTV Europe Award to best Spanish artist, and five Spanish music awards. They also went international with this version, when their album was released under a new version in America in 2003. They sold 900,000 copies.\n\nIn 2004, they were supposed to record an album and play with Bob Dylan when he visited Spain, but Juan suffered a wrist injury, so they had to delay the recording and Eva sang alone with Dylan. Finally in November of that year, Eva and Juan recorded their fourth album Pájaros en la cabeza (“Birds in the Head”, a Spanish expression meaning “dreamer”), again with Cameron Perkins. On March 14th 2004 they released it. It contained 14 songs, in a pop and rock style. They toured all over Spain until October, and later left to play in Mexico and Argentina. At the same time they recorded a concert for a DVD called El comienzo del Big Bang (The Beginning of the Big Bang). It was the best selling album in Spain in 2005, and sold about 600,000 copies worldwide. \n\nIn May 2008,  they released their fifth studio album named Gato negro.Dragón rojo (\"Black cat, red dragon\"). This is the first album in which Juan sings, in the track Es sólo una canción.\n\nEva has also sung with Moby.\n\nIn 2019 they released an album \"Salto Al Color.\"  This was followed by the European tour \"Giro Salto Al Color,\" which completed successfully in spite of many Covid-related postponements.\n\nOfficial site: www.amaral.es <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Amaral\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

When he was younger, his father started calling him Juanes, rather than Juan, a contraction of his two first names Juan and Esteban. As his friends grew to know him by this name, he chose to keep it for his musical career, which started when he, Andrés García, Fernando \"Toby\" Tobón and José David Lopera, formed the rock band Ekhymosis in 1988.\n\nHis politically-minded solo debut Fijate Bien (Take a good look) (2000) after Ekhymosis disbanded, earned him three Latin Grammys. The follow-up, Un Día Normal (A Normal Day) produced by Gustavo Santaolalla (2002), was a platinum mega-hit in Latin America and dominated that year's Latin Grammys, where he was nominated for and won five awards including Song of the Year and Album of the Year.\n\nIn the 2005 Latin Grammys, Juanes won three additional awards to his nine previous Grammy awards. He took the award for Best Rock Song for Nada Valgo Sin Tu Amor (I'm Worthless Without Your Love), Best Rock Solo Album for Mi Sangre (My Blood) and Best Music Video for Volverte a Ver (To see you again).\n\nHis most recent album, La Vida Es Un Ratico (Life is a little moment), was released in November 2007 and won him 3 awards at the 2008 Latin Grammy awards.

Having been a leader and voice of Alis Dee, jiennense worship band, and everything that happened to her, as the contract with EMI, Pachi decided to engage in production work from his studio in Baeza (Alis record) with countless groups such big names as Josele Santiago (doing preproduction on \"the swallows etc. ...\"), leaning to the road as a sound of bands like the Enemy, Chucho, Deluxe, Sexy Sadie, Pastora Soler, Medina Azahara, between other. So we thought we had lost a great musician gaining an excellent producer, and that we were wrong. We have not lost anything since Pachi back solo under the name of ALIS, reemerging as a phoenix from the ashes of his former band, and embraced by guitar Juan Pablo Huertas.\n\n2. An alter ego of Sabina Plamenova a.k.a. Subeena. Released the album Hybrids In The Attic in 2012.\n\n3. ALIS is an experimental electronic artist. They released an album on PLUS100 called Corporeal in April 2016.\n\n4. Alis is an artist from Albania, who participated in the annual Albanian music competition, Festivali i Këngës (FiK 63), with the song \"Mjegull\" and reached 3rd place overall in the competition. The following year he participated again in FiK 64 with the song \"Nân\" and won the competition.

        "biografia":"Procol Harum is a British rock band formed in London, England, in 1967. They contributed to the development of progressive rock, and by extension, symphonic rock. The band's claim to fame is 'A Whiter Shade of Pale', a huge hit in 1967. The band differed from most of the progressive rock bands of the 70s in the relatively prominent blues component to their sound, largely due to the voice and piano of leader Gary Brooker. In the early years, Matthew Fisher's organ and Robin Trower's guitar combined for a unique sound. In October 2012, the band was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but were unsuccessful as they failed to gain enough votes.\n\nProcol Harum is arguably the most successful \"accidental\" group creation -- that is, a band originally assembled to take advantage of the success of a record created in the studio -- in the history of progressive rock. With \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" a monster hit right out of the box, the band evolved from a studio ensemble into a successful live act, their music built around an eclectic mix of blues-based rock riffs and grand classical themes. With singer\/pianist Gary Brooker and lyricist Keith Reid providing the band's entire repertory, their music evolved in decidedly linear fashion, the only major surprises coming from the periodic lineup changes that added a new instrumental voice to the proceedings. At their most accessible, as on \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" and \"Conquistador,\" they were one of the most popular of progressive rock bands, their singles outselling all rivals, and their most ambitious album tracks still have a strong following.\n\nProcol Harum's roots and origins are as convoluted as its success -- especially between 1967 and 1973 -- was pronounced. Pianist Gary Brooker (b. May 29, 1945, Southend, Essex, England) had formed a group at school called the Paramounts at age 14, with guitarist Robin Trower (b. Mar. 9, 1945, Southend, Essex) and bassist Chris Copping (b. Aug. 29, 1945 Southend, Essex), with singer Bob Scott and drummer Mick Brownlee. After achieving a certain degree of success at local youth clubs and dances, covering established rock & roll hits, Brooker took over the vocalist spot from the departed Scott, and the group continued working after its members graduated -- by 1962, they were doing formidable (by British standards) covers of American R&B, and got a residency at the Shades Club in Southend.\n\nBrownlee exited the band in early 1963 and was replaced by Barry J. (B.J.) Wilson (b. Mar. 18, 1947, Southend, Essex), who auditioned after answering an ad in Melody Maker. Nine months later, in September of 1963, bassist Chris Copping opted out of the professional musicians' corps to attend Leicester University, and he was replaced by Diz Derrick. The following month, the Paramounts demo record, consisting of covers of the Coasters' \"Poison Ivy\" and Bobby Bland's \"Farther on up the Road,\" got them an audition at EMI. This resulted in their being signed to the Parlophone label, with their producer, Ron Richards, the recording manager best-known for his many years of work with the Hollies.\n\nThe Paramounts' first single, \"Poison Ivy,\" released in January of 1964, reached number 35 on the British charts. The group also got an important endorsement from the Rolling Stones, with whom they'd worked on the television show Thank Your Lucky Stars, who called the Paramounts their favorite British R&B band. Unfortunately, none of the group's subsequent Parlophone singles over the next 18 months found any chart success, and by mid-'66, the Paramounts had been reduced to serving as a backing band for popsters Sandy Shaw and Chris Andrews. In September of 1966, the Paramounts went their separate ways; Derrick out of the business, Trower and Wilson to gigs with other bands, and, most fortuitously, Gary Brooker decided to develop his career as a songwriter.\n\nThis led Brooker into a partnership with lyricist Keith Reid (b. Oct. 19, 1945), whom he met through a mutual acquaintance, R&B impresario Guy Stevens. By the spring of 1967, they had a considerable body of songs prepared and began looking for a band to play them. An advertisement in Melody Maker led to the formation of a band initially called the Pinewoods, with Brooker as pianist\/singer, Matthew Fisher (b. Mar. 7, 1946, Croydon, Surrey) on organ, Ray Royer (b. Oct. 8, 1945) on guitar, Dave Knights (b. June 28, 1945, London) on bass, and Bobby Harrison (b. June 28, 1943, London) on drums. Their first recording, produced by Denny Cordell, was of a piece of surreal Reid poetry called \"A Whiter Shade Of Pale,\" which Brooker set to music loosely derived from Johann Sebastian Bach's Air on a G String from the Suite No. 3 in D Major.\n\nBy the time this recording was ready for release, the Pinewoods had been rechristened Procol Harum, a name derived, as alternate stories tell it, either from Stevens' cat's birth certificate, Procol Harun, or the Latin \"procul\" for \"far from these things\" (hey, it was the mid-'60s, and either is possible). In early May of 1967, the group performed \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" at the Speakeasy Club in London, while Cordell arranged for a release of the single on English Decca (London Records in America), on the companies' Deram label. Ironically, Cordell's one-time clients the Moody Blues were about to break out of a long commercial tail-spin on the very same label with a similar, classically-tinged pair of recordings, \"Nights in White Satin\" and \"Days of Future Passed,\" and between the two groups and their breakthrough hits, Deram Records would be permanently characterized as a progressive rock imprint.\n\nCordell had also sent a copy of \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" to Radio London, one of England's legendary off-shore pirate radio stations (they competed with the staid BBC, which had the official broadcast monopoly, and were infinitely more beloved by the teenagers and most bands), which played the record. Not only was Radio London deluged with listener requests for more plays, but Deram suddenly found itself with orders for a record not scheduled for release for another month -- before May was half over, it was pushed up on the schedule and rushed into shops.\n\nMeanwhile, the prototypal Procol Harum made its concert debut in London opening for Jimi Hendrix at the Saville Theater on June 4, 1967. Four days later, \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" reached the top of the British charts for the first of a six-week run in the top spot, making Procol Harum only the sixth recording act in the history of British popular music to reach the number one spot on its first release (not even the Beatles did that). The following month, the record reached number five on the American charts, with sales in the United States rising to over a million copies (and six million copies worldwide).\n\nAll of this seemed to bode well for the band, except for the fact that it had only a single song in its repertory and no real stage act -- literal one-hit wonders. The same month that the record peaked in the United States, Royer and Harrison were sacked and replaced by Brooker's former Paramounts bandmates Robin Trower and B.J. Wilson on guitar and drums, respectively.\n\nThe \"real\" Procol Harum band was now in place and a second single, \"Homburg,\" was duly recorded. Reminiscent of \"Whiter Shade of Pale\" in its tone of dark grandeur, this single, released in October of 1967 on EMI's Regal Zonophone label, got to number six on the British charts. The group's debut album, entitled Procol Harum, managed to reach number 47 in America during October of 1967, based on \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" being among its tracks (which included the first version of \"Conquistador\") -- but a British version of the LP, issued over there without the hit, failed to attract any significant sales. The single \"Homburg,\" however, got no higher than number 34 in America a month later.\n\nOn March 26, 1968, \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" won the International Song of the Year award at the 13th Annual Ivor Novello Awards (sort of the British equivalent of the Grammys). The group's newest single, \"Quite Rightly So,\" however, only reached the number 50 spot in England in April of that year. A new contract for the group was secured with A&M Records in America (they remained on Regal Zonophone in England), and by November, a second album, Shine on Brightly, highlighted by an 18-minute epic entitled \"In Held 'Twas I,\" was finished and in the stores, and rose to number 24 in America but failed to chart in England. The next month, they were playing the Miami Pop Festival in front of 100,000 people, on a bill that included Chuck Berry, Canned Heat, the blues version of Fleetwood Mac, and the Turtles, among others.\n\nIn March of 1969, David Knights and Matthew Fisher exited the lineup shortly after finishing work on the group's new album, A Salty Dog, preferring management and production to the performing side of the music business. Knights' departure opened the way for bassist Chris Copping to join Procol Harum (thus re-creating the lineup of the Paramounts), playing bass and organ. Another American tour followed the next month, and in June of 1969 A Salty Dog was issued. This record, considered by many to be the original group's best work, combined high-energy blues and classical influences on a grand scale, and returned the band to the U.S. charts at number 32, while the title song ascended the British charts to number 44. The album subsequently reached number 27 in England, the group's first long-player to chart in their own country.\n\nDespite the group's moderate sales in England and America, they remained among the more popular progressive rock bands, capable of reaching more middle-brow listeners who didn't have the patience for Emerson, Lake & Palmer or King Crimson. Robin Trower's flashy guitar quickly made him the star of the group, as much as singer\/pianist Brooker, and he was considered in the same league with Alvin Lee and any number of late-'60s\/early-'70s British blues axemen. Matthew Fisher's stately, cathedral-like organ had been a seminal part of the band's sound, juxtaposed with Trower's blues-based riffing and Reid's unusual, darkly witty lyrics as voiced by Brooker. Following Fisher's departure, the group took on a more straightforward rock sound, but Trower's playing remained a major attraction to the majority of fans.\n\n\"Whaling Stories\" was an example of quintessential Procol Harum, a mix of 19th century oratorio that sounds like it came out of a Victorian-era cathedral, with fiery blues riffs blazing at its center. And being soaked in Reid's dark, eerie, regret-filled lyrics didn't stop \"A Salty Dog\" from becoming one of the group's most popular songs.\n\nIt was a year before their next album, Home, was released, in June of 1970, ascending to the American number 34 and the British 49 spot. This marked the end of the group's contract with Regal Zonophone\/EMI, and on the release of their next LP in July of 1971, they were now on Chrysalis in England. Broken Barricades reached number 32 in America and 41 in England, but it also marked the departure of Robin Trower. The founding guitarist left that month and subsequently organized his own group, with a sound modeled along lines similar to Jimi Hendrix, which had great success in America throughout the 1970s.\n\nTrower's replacement, Dave Ball (b. Mar. 30, 1950), joined the same month, and the lineup expanded by one with the addition of Alan Cartwright on bass, which freed Chris Copping to concentrate full-time on the organ. The group returned to something of the sound it had before Fisher's departure, although Trower was a tough act to follow. It was this version of the band that performed on August 6, 1971 in a concert with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra and the DaCamera Singers in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada -- the concert was a bold and expansive, richly orchestrated re-consideration of earlier material (though not \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\") from the group's repertory, and, released as an official live album in 1972, proved to be the group's most successful LP release, peaking at number five and drawing in thousands of new fans.\n\nIn England, Procol Harum Live: In Concert With the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra only rose to number 48 in May of 1972, but it was competing with a reissue of the group's debut album (retitled A Whiter Shade of Pale, with the single added) paired with A Salty Dog, which outperformed it considerably, reaching number 26. A single lifted from the live record, \"Conquistador,\" redone in a rich and dramatic version, shot to number 16 in America and 22 in England that summer. Soon after, the U.S. distributor of the debut album, London Records, got further play from that record by re-releasing it with a sticker announcing the presence of \"the original version of \"Conquistador.\"\n\nAmid all of this success, the group's lineup again was thrown into turmoil in September when Dave Ball left Procol Harum to join Long John Baldry's band. He was replaced by Mick Grabham, formerly of the bands Plastic Penny and Cochise. The band's next album, Grand Hotel, was a delightfully melodic and decadent collection (anticipating Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music in some respects) that featured guest backing vocals by Christianne Legrand of the a cappella singing group the Swingle Singers. That record, their first released on Chrysalis in America as well as England, peaked at number 21. Six months later, A&M released the first compilation of the band's material, Best of Procol Harum, which only made it to number 131 on the charts.\n\nThe group's next two albums, Exotic Birds and Fruit (May 1974) and Procol's Ninth (September 1975), the latter produced by rock & roll songsmiths Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, performed moderately well, and \"Pandora's Box\" from Procol's Ninth became one of their bigger hits in England, rising to number 16. July of 1976 saw a departure and a lateral shift in the group's lineup, as Alan Cartwright left the band and Chris Copping took over on bass, while Pete Solley joined as keyboard player.\n\nBy this time, the band's string had run out, as everyone seemed to know. A new album, Something Magic, barely scraped the U.S. charts in April of 1977, and the band split up following a final tour and a farewell concert at New York's Academy of Music on May 15, 1977. Only five months later, the band was back together for a one-off performance of \"A Whiter Shade of Pale,\" which had taken on a life of its own separate from the group -- the song was named joint winner (along with \"Bohemian Rhapsody\") of the Best British Pop Single 1952-1977, at the Britannia Awards to mark Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee, and the band performed it live at the awards ceremony.\n\nApart from Trower, Gary Brooker was the most successful and visible of all ex-Procol Harum members, releasing three solo albums between 1979 and 1985. Fear of Flying (1979) on Chrysalis, produced by George Martin, attracted the most attention, but Lead Me to the Water (1982) on Mercury had some notable guest artists, including Eric Clapton and Phil Collins, while Echoes in the Night (1985) was co-produced by Brooker's former bandmate Matthew Fisher. During the late '80s, however, Brooker had turned to writing orchestral music, principally ballet material, but this didn't stop him from turning up as a guest at one of the annual Fairport Convention reunions (Procol Harum and Fairport had played some important early gigs together) at Cropredy, Oxfordshire, in August of 1990 to sing \"A Whiter Shade of Pale.\"\n\nStill, Procol Harum had faded from the consciousness of the music world by the end of the 1980s. The death of B.J. Wilson in 1990 went largely unreported, to the chagrin of many fans, and it seemed as though the group was a closed book.\n\nThen, in August of 1991, Brooker re-formed Procol Harum with Trower, Fisher, Reid, and drummer Mark Brzezicki. An album, Prodigal Stranger, was recorded and released, and an 11-city tour of North America took place in September of 1991. Although this lineup didn't last -- Trower and company, after all, were pushing 50 at the time -- Brooker has kept a new version of Procol Harum together, in the guise of himself, guitarist Geoffrey Whitehorn, keyboardman Don Snow, and Brzezicki on drums, which toured the United States in 1992.\n\nIn 2003, the band released the album The Well's on Fire. Since then the band has continued to tour regularly. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Procol+Harum\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Public is a three-piece indie pop group hailing from Cincinnati, Ohio. The band consists of John Vaughan on lead vocals and guitar, Ben Lapps on drums, and Matt Alvarado on bass. They formed in 2008, initially starting as a songwriting duo with Vaughan and Lapps before Alvarado joined to complete the current lineup of Public.\n\nDrawing inspiration from their roots in classic rock and indie pop, Public released their first EP titled \"Red\" in 2012, quickly establishing a strong local fanbase in Cincinnati. Their energetic performances and infectious sound caught the attention of renowned acts like Walk the Moon, Twenty One Pilots, and Young the Giant, leading to opportunities for the band to support these artists on tour. Public also made appearances at notable festivals including Forecastle, Bunbury, CMJ, and SXSW, exposing them to diverse crowds and expanding their reach.\n\nFollowing their second EP release, \"Let's Make It,\" and a national tour supporting Walk the Moon, Public ventured to Los Angeles, California, to collaborate with producer Eric Palmquist (known for his work with Mars Volta and Bad Suns). Immersed in a new creative environment and drawing from their experiences on the road, the band embraced alternative and pop influences, resulting in the creation of their 2015 single, \"Heartbeating.\" The release coincided with their national tour alongside Oh Honey and received favorable recognition from respected blogs such as Kings of A&R and Good Music All Day, which praised Public's harmonies and captivating indie style.\n\nIn 2019, Public experienced a breakthrough with their single \"Make You Mine.\" Originally self-released in 2015, the song gained significant traction after going viral on TikTok, accumulating over 2.5 million TikTok videos featuring the track. The band's success on the platform and their partnership with Jonas Group Entertainment, headed by Kevin Jonas Sr., caught the attention of major record labels. In July 2019, Public signed with Island Records.\n\nFollowing their signing, Public released a new version of \"Make You Mine\" that was mixed by Grammy Award winners Chris Lord-Alge and mastered by Emily Lazar. The track became a sensation on TikTok, reaching the number four spot on the trending charts and accumulating over 7 million streams per week. To date, \"Make You Mine\" has garnered over 260 million streams. On May 8, the group released their new single \"Honey in the Summer,\" a breezy laid-back love song co-written and produced by John Fields. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Public\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

He found fame as a member of the pop group Take That from 1990 to 1995, and achieved commercial success after launching a solo career in 1996. His debut studio album, Life thru a Lens, was released in 1997, and included his signature song, \"Angels\". His second album, I've Been Expecting You, featured the songs \"Millennium\" and \"She's the One\", his first number one singles. His discography includes seven UK No. 1 singles, and all but one of his 14 studio albums have reached No. 1 in the UK. Six of his albums are among the top 100 biggest-selling albums in the UK, with two of them in the top 60, and he gained a Guinness World Record in 2006 for selling 1.6 million tickets in a single day during his Close Encounters Tour.\n\nWilliams has received a record 18 Brit Awards, winning Best British Male Artist four times, Outstanding Contribution to Music twice, an Icon Award for his lasting impact on British culture, eight German ECHO Awards, and three MTV European Music Awards. In 2004, he was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame after being voted the Greatest Artist of the 1990s. According to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), he has been certified for 20.2 million albums and 8.66 million singles in the UK as a solo artist. Five of his albums have also topped the Australian albums chart, and has sold 75 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He also topped the 2000–2010 UK airplay chart. His three concerts at Knebworth in 2003 drew over 375,000 people, the UK's biggest music event to that point. In 2014, he was awarded the freedom of his hometown of Stoke-on-Trent and had a tourist trail created and streets named in his honour. Williams' thirteenth album, XXV was released on 9 September 2022.\n\nAfter 15 years, Williams rejoined Take That in 2010 to co-write and perform lead vocals on their album Progress, which became the second-fastest-selling album in UK chart history and the fastest-selling record of the century at the time. The subsequent stadium tour, which featured seven songs from Williams' solo career, became the biggest-selling concert in UK history when it sold 1.34 million tickets in less than 24 hours. In 2011, Take That frontman Gary Barlow confirmed that Williams had left the band for a second time to focus on his solo career, although he stated that the departure was amicable and that Williams was welcome to rejoin Take That in the future. Williams has since performed with Take That on three separate television appearances, and collaborated with Barlow on a number of projects such as the West End musical The Band. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Robbie+Williams\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Andrew Bird (born July 11, 1973) is an American musician. He was born in Lake Bluff, Illinois but currently resides in the Los Angeles area. Bird is a singer, a violinist and, since 2004, a guitarist. He is also an accomplished whistler.\n\nHis early work, which echoed gypsy jazz and traditional folk, has led into his current sound, which mixes rock with more broad compositions. His years of solo song-craft have now enabled him to produce a sound that is uniquely his own.\n\nTrained by the Suzuki method from a young age and a graduate of Illinois' Northwestern University, Bird released his first solo album, Music of Hair, in  1996. Vastly different from his later releases, this first album showcases his violin skills and pays tribute to his fascination with both American and European folk traditions, as well as jazz and blues.\n\nHis initial commercial exposure was in collaborative work with the band Squirrel Nut Zippers. He was quickly lumped in with the swing craze that swept the United States music industry in the mid '90s; this is an affiliation that he is still working to shed.\n\nTaking on the role of band leader in 1997 with Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire, he released the album Thrills. This was followed by Oh! The Grandeur in 1998. Both albums were heavily influenced by traditional folk, pre-war jazz and swing, with Bird relying on the violin as his primary musical instrument.\n\nIn 2001, Bird released The Swimming Hour, his third release with the Bowl of Fire and a dramatic departure from previous recordings. The Swimming Hour featured a mixture of styles, from the zydeco-influenced \"Core and Rind\" to more straightforward rock songs. He has often referred to this record as his \"jukebox album\".\n\nThe Bowl of Fire unofficially disbanded some time in 2003, having featured many skilled Chicago musicians including Kevin O'Donnell, Nora O'Connor, Andy Hopkins (aka Mr. Rudy Day), Jimmy Sutton, Colin Bunn and Ryan Hembrey.\n\nBird then released two subsequent solo albums, both distributed through the label operated by Ani DiFranco, Righteous Babe Records. The two records, 2003's Weather Systems and 2005's The Mysterious Production of Eggs, continue a progression towards an eclectic indie folk sound that has proven challenging to classify.\n\nBird's live solo shows have been notable in that he uses a multi-track system to sample and loop his own performance. For example, he may record a snippet of his performance on violin, then play a \"loop\" of that sound. This provides a more full-bodied sound and aurally suggests a band performance, rather than the sound of a solo artist.\n\nBird's next full-length album Armchair Apocrypha (Fat Possum) was released on March 20th 2007.\n\nNovember 2007 saw the Soldier On EP originally a European tour-only release. But due to high demand and unanticipated critical acclaim was released digitally and in CD-format on both sides of the Atlantic. Critics and fans alike have hearkened to the EP's first track, \"The Trees Were Mistaken\", a complex yet austere looping composition that marks a departure from Bird's earlier body of work. It also contains a cover of Bob Dylan's \"Oh Sister\".\n\nJanuary 2009 saw Noble Beast, also available with instrumental album Useless Creatures, released worldwide to positive reviews.\n\nThe Fatal Shore Songfacts reports that Break it Yourself, Bird's sixth solo studio album, was released on March 6, 2012 through Mom+Pop records in the US and Bella Union in the UK. The origins of the LP lie in a couple of jam sessions by a gathering of Bird's friends in the singer's western Illinois barn, near the banks of the Mississippi River.\n\nOf his 2019 album My Finest Work Yet, Talia Schlanger of NPR says \"Bird zooms way out on humanity across history's timeline, seeking insight about our current age, in a way he hopes 'stays above the news feed noise.'\"  Many tracks, including the opener \"Sisyphus,\" include Andrew's trademark whistling. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Andrew+Bird\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Growing up in Louisville, Kentucky, Ian was influenced by genre-blending artists like The Red Hot Chili Peppers and Kid Cudi,  and began writing lyrics at the age of 15. Encouraged by friends and family, he released a series of mixtapes and an EP which made the iTunes Top 25 pop charts.\n\nWith success came a strong sense of discouragement regarding the future of his career. Ian chose to take a break from music to attend Indiana University. He graduated in 2016, triple majoring in business. He took his shot at the American Dream by accepting a job offer in Anheuser-Busch's’ Global Management Program. Within eight months, he was offered a promotion and raise that would entail 60+ hour work weeks. He turned down the offer to pursue his music career instead.\n\n“Working in corporate America was a struggle for me,” Ian noted. “I found myself waking up every day feeling like a prisoner. I started writing music again as an outlet to express my frustrations.”\n\n That fall he released his debut single “My Friends Are Robots”, an ode to the lack of creativity and self-expression he experienced while working in corporate America. He followed up with the hard-hitting, alt-anthem “A Painting in Paris”, paying tribute to the vanity of his generation. He captured a feeling and emotion he feels his generation is experiencing — uncertainty surrounding how we present ourselves in a digital world. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Arrested+Youth\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Wham! (often written WHAM!) was a pop band formed in 1981 from Bushey, England. They were briefly known in the United States as Wham! UK due to a naming conflict with another band.\n\nGeorge Michael and Andrew Ridgeley met at Bushey Meads School in Watford, England. At first, they performed in a short-lived rock and roll band called The Executive. They then changed their name and signed with Innervision Records. Soon after a legal victory over Innervision, the duo was signed to CBS, Columbia Records in the United States and Canada and Epic Records for the rest of the world.\n\nFurther information: Artist development deal \nMichael took on the majority of roles and responsibilities within the band— composer, singer, producer, and occasional instrumentalist— but the contribution of Ridgeley as the group's image specialist and spokesman was crucial to the band's initial success. Ridgeley convinced a reluctant George that Wham! needed to change their image and sound frequently, from the leather-clad moody singers of \"Bad Boys\" and \"Young Guns (Go For It!)\" to the more fashionable pop superstars of \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go.\"\n\nStill teenagers, they promoted themselves as hedonistic youngsters, proud to live a carefree life without work or commitment. This was reflected in their earliest singles. Such works as \"Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do?)\" have been seen as sarcasm advocating the other point of view.\n\nThe first record to be released by the band was \"Wham Rap!\". It was a double-A side with a Social Mix and Anti-social Mix. The record was banned for general release in the UK due to the profanity in the Anti-social Mix. In October 1982, their song \"Young Guns (Go For It!)\" was issued. The song was an appeal from one youthful lad to his friend to not throw his life away so early on marriage. It stalled outside the UK Top 40 but then Wham! got lucky when Top Of The Pops scheduled them. An important weekly BBC chart show on television, it had to look outside the Top 40 to fill a gap created by an act which had pulled out of recording. Nearest to the 40 mark and still climbing, Wham! was summoned, and a phenomenon immediately began.\n\nThe impact of Wham! on the public, especially teenage girls, was felt from the moment they finished their debut performance of \"Young Guns (Go For It!)\" on Top Of The Pops. Michael's appearance may have helped. He wore espadrilles, a suede jacket slit open, and rolled-up denim jeans. Ridgeley stood behind him, flanked by backing dancers D.C. Lee and Shirlie Holliman.\n\nThe performance was as much one of acting as it was of singing, with Michael playing the part of the pleading goodtime lad, and Ridgeley the guy who had been drawn into commitment. Afterwards, the song shot into the Top 40 at #24 and peaked at #3 in December. The following year (1983), D.C. Lee began her work with Paul Weller of The Style Council, and was replaced by Pepsi DeMacque. Holliman and DeMacque would later record music as Pepsi and Shirlie.\n\nWham! followed up \"Young Guns (Go For It!)\" with the reissue \"Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)\", a song about the joys of a leisurely life (the full version of which clocked in at almost seven minutes long); \"Bad Boys\", about a strained relationship between a rebellious teenage lad and his worried parents; and \"Club Tropicana\", a satire of the Club 18-30 scene. Each song came with a memorable music video.\n\nBy the end of 1983, Wham! was rivaling Duran Duran and Culture Club as Britain's biggest pop act. Notoriety and column inches were duly achieved with their antics of placing a shuttlecock down their shorts, and their first album Fantastic reached #1.\n\nAround this time, Ridgeley become conscious of legal problems with their initial contract at Innervision. He mounted a legal challenge against the record company and its founder Mark Dean, who had initially signed them to the label, and George publicly stated they were financially mistreated [citation needed]. While the legal battle raged (perhaps to raise much-needed funds for the fight), Innervision released a medley of non-single album tracks from Fantastic, entitled Club Fantastic Megamix. Wham! publicly denounced the move, and urged fans not to buy it. After all the legal wrangling, Innervision admitted there were royalty discrepancies with Wham!'s contract, leading to the bankruptcy and dissolution of Innervision.\n\nDriven by Ridgeley, the duo changed their image, and Wham! returned in May 1984 with an updated, cutting-edge pop image quickly copied by other pop bands. Andrew changed the band's look from \"moody in leather jackets\" to smiles and fashionable clothing, with an aim to promote themselves more as sex symbols rather than spokespeople for a disaffected generation.\n\nFittingly enough, these changes propelled the next single (a pop standard) to the top of the charts around the world. Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go, a song Michael wrote from a note left to him in his hotel room one night by Ridgeley. The note was mistakenly written by Ridgeley as \"don't forget to wake me up up before you go go, George\". Since he accidentally wrote the word \"up\" twice, Ridgeley decided to compound the error and write \"go\" twice. It became their first UK #1 and rose to the top in the USA), capped by a memorable video of the duo, plus the ubiquitous Pepsi and Shirlie, wearing Katharine Hamnett T-shirts with the slogans CHOOSE LIFE and GO GO.\n\nThese t-shirts became essential fashion items as Hamnett wrote herself into the pop culture lexicon, having simultaneously designed the FRANKIE SAY t-shirts for Frankie Goes to Hollywood.\n\nAlthough some critics felt that Wham! represented bubblegum pop[citation needed], many were starting to appreciate Michael's proven ability as a songwriter and capable vocalist. (The following year, he would win the Ivor Novello Award for songwriting.) However, at the same time they bemoaned the status of Ridgeley, who had started to \"play\" a guitar during live shows (never on any recordings) but whose overall contribution was deemed to be lightweight[citation needed].\n\nWith some bizarre contradiction, the next single \"Careless Whisper\" was issued as a George Michael solo piece, yet unlike any Wham! single since \"Wham Rap!,\" it was co-written by Ridgeley. The song quickly reached #1. In the autumn of 1984, Wham! came back as a duo with \"Freedom\", another chart-topper. In November, they released their second album, Make It Big, which coasted to #1 on the album charts. The band set off on another arena tour at the end of '84, and George told Smash Hits magazine at the time that he had written a song called \"Stephen.\" The song had been composed for a friend who was struggling to cope with bereavment. While this song is still unreleased, those that were at the recording sessions decsribe it as a heartfelt story of the loss of a loved one[citation needed].\n\nGeorge contributed to the Band Aid project, with Michael providing vocals as the song usurped their own Christmas release, \"Last Christmas\"\/\"Everything She Wants\", the former of which featured a video set in a ski resort.\n\nThe single became the highest-selling single ever to peak at #2 in the UK charts. As such, Wham! donated all their royalties to the Ethiopian famine appeal to coincide with the fundraising intentions of Band Aid, the song which beat them to the top spot. Band Aid's success meant that Michael had been at #1 within three different entities in 1984—as a solo artist, half of a duo, and part of a charity ensemble.\n\nMichael desired to create music targeted to a more sophisticated audience than the duo's primarily teenage fanbase. Therefore, Michael and Ridgeley announced the breakup of Wham! in the spring of 1986, destined to take place after a farewell single and album, along with a historic grand finale concert at Wembley Stadium on June 28, 1986, called The Final. British pop group Five Star declined George's invitation to be the supporting act, saying they needed to concentrate on their own career at the time. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Wham%21\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"There are at least 5 bands named \"Waste\".\n\nThe First is black metal band from Sweden formed in 2003 by drummer P.J and singer\/guitarplayer A.k.A. Soon, D.R joined the band on bass. Two demos were released with this lineup, \"Waste\" (2003) and \"Banish Life Forever\" (2004). In the winter of 2004 Patrik joined in bass, D.R moved on to playing guitar and A.k.A concentrated on vocals. But soon, D.R dropped out and A.k.A picked up the guitar again. A demo was released in the spring of 2005 called \"No Room For Happiness Here\", but since then not much have been heard from them. There was supposed to be another demo coming out in early 2007, but the info on it has been inconsistant. \n\n\nThe second is a very young German punk band having this very clever name. Founded in summer 2004 they have recorded an EP (Niggle EP), featuring \"Welcome to Happyland\", \"At the Swimmingpool\", \"Without Chocolate\", \"Fly-Flap\" and \"Liars are Stupid\". In late 2006 they released their 10-track debut \"That's Fact\", featuring 2 of their already released songs and 8 new ones. While their latest release was still most influenced by contemporary punkbands, their style remains in transit and appears to evolve into more mature and heavy sound. Their next effort is planned to be released later in 2007. Current line-up:\n\n\nThe third is the anti-folk artist from Michigan. She distributes her music for free from her website.\nMost Excellent Records will release a CD of whiskey-related songs by Waste sometime in 2007.\n\nThe fourth \"Waste\" were a Dutch punkband in the early eighties. They released one selftitled 7\" that is sometimes called \"Blue Lights\" and then faded away. They sounded pretty similiar to the melodic UK punk of those days. \n\nThe fifth \"WASTE\" is a german Alternative\/Post Hardcore Band from Hamburg, Germany. WASTE is an acronym for : \"With all sudden tender emotions.\" They act since 2008, and played few concerts already. 3 Songs are already recorded.\n\nAnd there is another one who is a cover band playing in the south of France under this name and who plays originals under the name of \"Komä\".\n\nAnother Waste, a thrash metal outfit from Sisak, Croatia, existed in the period from 2004 -2007, durig that time they did numerous demo recordings of their songs, of wich some ended  up on their Demo I, they also have a recoded performance on MUF (mali urbani festival) in Sisak, a few months after they broke up due to some disputes over their future.\nThe line-up was: Jurica - Guitars and Vocals, Dino V - Guitars , Marko Š- Bass, Gogo - Drums\nToday Marko is a sound tehnician working in the local club SKWHAT and also records bands, while Jurica and Gogo play in Kvltivator\n\nAnother Waste, hails from Minneapolis Minnesota. They are a deathcore group, playing a style similar to the likes of Spite and Traitors. They released an EP titled \"The Cycle of Hatred\" in 2020, and an LP titled \"Pray For Nothing\" in 2021. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Waste\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"The Strokes is an American indie rock band, known for their distinctive sound and cultural impact, particularly in the early 2000s.\n\nMembers\nJulian Casablancas (vocals), Nick Valensi (guitar), Albert Hammond Jr. (guitar), Nikolai Fraiture (bass), and Fabrizio Moretti (drums)\n\nFormation\nThe founding process of The Strokes was a serendipitous convergence of childhood connections and a shared musical vision. Julian Casablancas, Fabrizio Moretti, and Nick Valensi, childhood friends with varying musical experiences, came together in the late '90s. The trio's dynamic was enriched with the addition of guitarist Albert Hammond Jr. and bassist Nikolai Fraiture. Bonded by a mutual love for garage rock, punk, and new wave, the quintet officially formed The Strokes in 1998, embarking on a journey to synthesize their diverse influences into a sound that would later redefine the alternative rock landscape. The amalgamation of their individual talents and shared passion for music set the stage for The Strokes' rise to prominence in the early 2000s.\n\nIs This It (2001)\n\"Is This It\" The Strokes\" debut album released in 2001 under the reputable record label RCA, is an electrifying sonic manifesto that not only redefined the landscape of indie rock but also garnered widespread critical acclaim. Infused with a raw and unfiltered energy, the album became an instant classic, hailed for its gritty exploration of New York City's underground music scene. Featuring iconic tracks like \"Last Nite\" and \"Someday,\" Julian Casablancas' charismatic vocals, Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr.'s guitar interplay, and the band's overall swagger made \"Is This It\" a timeless masterpiece. Its critical acclaim propelled The Strokes to the forefront of the early 2000s indie rock revival, cementing their status as trailblazers in the genre.\n\nRoom On Fire (2003)\n\"Room On Fire\" the sophomore album by The Strokes released in 2003, seamlessly follows the success of their groundbreaking debut, \"Is This It\" The Strokes\" (2001). While \"Is This It\" The Strokes\" quickly became a cultural touchstone and achieved widespread acclaim, \"Room On Fire\" faced the challenge of living up to its predecessor's legacy.\nFrom the rhythmic urgency of \"12:51\" to the infectious guitar riffs of \"Reptilia,\" each track on \"Room On Fire\" showcases The Strokes' continued commitment to crafting catchy, yet substantive, rock anthems. While not eclipsing the commercial success of their debut, the album solidified The Strokes' standing as stalwarts of the early 2000s rock revival, demonstrating their artistic growth and ability to sustain their unique sound.\n\n Juicebox and First Impressions Of Earth (2005 - 2006)\n\"Juicebox\" by The Strokes, released as a single on November 14, 2005, ahead of their album \"First Impressions of Earth,\" faced an early online leak, adding to the anticipation. Despite this, the track's bold guitar riffs and Julian Casablancas' charismatic vocals contributed to its positive reception, marking a significant moment in The Strokes' musical journey. They also released a catchy B-side \"Hawaii\".\n\n\"First Impressions Of Earth\" The Strokes' third studio album released in January 2006, received a mix of reviews. Critics praised the album's experimental departure from the band's earlier sound, commending Julian Casablancas' introspective lyrics, dynamic guitar work, and rhythmic innovation. Standout tracks like \"Juicebox\" and \"You Only Live Once\" showcased The Strokes' ability to evolve while retaining their signature coolness. Despite differing opinions, the album marked a bold exploration of new musical territories and sparked conversations about the band's artistic evolution within the indie rock landscape.\n\nAngles (2011)\n\"Angles\" released by The Strokes in 2011, is a pivotal album in the band's journey, receiving a mix of reviews. Critics lauded its experimentation and collaborative nature, showcasing a departure from their previous works. Standout tracks like \"Under Cover of Darkness\" and \"Machu Picchu\" received praise for blending The Strokes' signature sound with fresh influences. While some critics found the album's diversity refreshing, others felt it lacked cohesion. Despite mixed reviews, \"Angles\" signaled The Strokes' return with a revitalized energy, sparking conversations about their evolving musical direction.\n\nComedown Machine (2013)\n\"Comedown Machine\" released by The Strokes in 2013, is a unique entry in their discography. The album showcases a departure from their traditional sound, embracing a more synth-driven and experimental approach. Tracks like \"One Way Trigger\" and \"Tap Out\" demonstrate The Strokes' willingness to evolve, dividing critics but still affirming their capacity for sonic exploration. \"Comedown Machine\" adds another layer to The Strokes' musical evolution, inviting listeners into a realm of unexpected sounds and creative divergence. The Strokes adopted a media blackout strategy, refraining from interviews and traditional promotional activities. This intentional approach added an air of mystery to the album's release, sparking curiosity and discussions about the band's creative intentions.\n\nFuture Present Past EP (2016)\n\"Future Present Past\" is a 2016 EP by The Strokes, featuring tracks like \"Drag Queen\", \"OBLIVIOUS\" and \"Threat Of Joy\" offering a glimpse into the band's evolving sound during the period between their albums \"Comedown Machine\" and \"The New Abnormal\".\n\nThe New Abnormal (2020)\nProduced by legendary music producer Rick Rubin, \"The New Abnormal\" is The Strokes' sixth studio album, released in 2020 after a seven-year hiatus. The album represents a return to the spotlight for the band and showcases a blend of their signature rock sound with fresh and contemporary elements. Notable tracks include \"The Adults Are Talking\" and \"Selfless\". \"The New Abnormal\" received critical acclaim for its maturity, experimentation, and the band's ability to evolve while staying true to their distinctive style. The album's release was a highly anticipated moment for fans, marking a successful comeback for The Strokes after their extended hiatus. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Strokes\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Sidecars ¿No son un encanto?\n\n\nKike Babas y Kike Turrón.\n\n\nActualmente se encuentran grabando su primer trabajo de estudio bajo la supervisión y producción de Leiva (miembro de Pereza). \n\nMás información en http:\/\/www.sidecarsrock.com\/ <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Sidecars\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Ara Malikian is undoubtedly one of the most brilliant and expressive violinists of his generation. In possession of a personal style, forged from his own origins and rich musical experience, his artistic voice has emerged as an original and innovative presence on the world musical scene. \n\nBorn in Lebanon in 1968 to an Armenian family, Ara Malikian began studying the violin at a very early age with his father. His talent was recognized and nurtured despite the difficulties encountered because of the war, forcing him to study during long periods of time in air-raid shelters. He gave his first concert of significance at the age of 12 and when he was 14, German conductor Hans Herbert Joris heard him and obtained a grant from the German government to study at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hannover. At 15, he was the youngest pupil to be admitted in this prestigious centre for higher musical studies.\n\nHe later furthered his studies at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama in London, and studied with renowned professors such as Franco Gulli, Ruggiero Ricci, Ivry Gitlis, Herman Krebbers and members of the Alban Berg Quartett.\n\nAn undiminishing musical and human restlessness have led Ara Malikian to deepen his relationship with his own Armenian roots, and to assimilate the music of other cultures like those of the Middle East (Arab and Jewish), Central Europe (gypsy and kletzmer), Argentina (tango) and Spain (flamenco). All this is achieved within a personal language in which the rhythmic and emotional strength of these types of music go hand in hand with the virtuosity and expressiveness of the great European classical tradition.\n\nWith a wide-ranging repertoire, that includes the great majority of all the important pieces written for the violin (concertos with orchestra, sonatas and pieces with piano and chamber music), he has also premiered works by modern composers such as Franco Danatoni, Malcolm Lipkin, Luciano Chailly, Ladislav Kupkovich, Loris Tjeknavorian, Lawrence Roman and Yervand Yernakian. Malikian is also one of the few violinists who plays recitals for solo violin with programs featuring completes cycles of significant works such as the 24 Paganini Caprices, the six sonatas of Eugene Ysaÿe, and the sonatas and partitas of Bach. \n\nMalikian has been recognized in many competitions of worldwide reputation, including first prizes at the International Competitions “Felix Mendelssohn” (1987, Berlin, Germany) and “Pablo Sarasate” (1995, Pamplona, Spain). In addition, he has been prizewinner in the competitions “Niccolo Paganini” (Genoa, Italy), “Zino Francescatti” (Marseille, France), “Rodolfo Lipizer” (Gorizia, Italy), “Jeunesses Musicales” (Belgrade, Yugoslavia), “Rameau” (Le Mans, Francia), “International Artists Guild” (New York, USA), and the “International Music Competition of Japan”. In 1993 he received the “Prize for Artistic Devotion and Achievement” from the German Ministry of Culture. \n\nMalikian has performed in the most important concert halls of the world in more than 40 countries on five continents: New York (Carnegie Hall), Paris (Salle Pleyel), Viene (Musikverein), Toronto (Ford Center), Madrid (Auditorio Nacional and Teatro Real), Venice, Los Angeles, Taipei, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Cuba, Barcelona, and Bilbao, among many others. He has also participated in the festivals at Aspen, Colamar, Prades, Schleswig Holstein, Braunschweig, San Sebastian, Segovia, Bergen, Freden, Metlach and Prague.\n\nAs soloist, he has performed with orchestras such as the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra, Bamberg Symphony Orchestra, Zürich Chamber Orchestra, London Chamber Orchestra, Genova Opera Orchestra, Sinfónica de Madrid, Sinfónica de Portugal, Chamber Orchesta of Tubingen, Moscu Virtuosi, Belgrade Philharmonic, Toulouse Chamber Orchesta, Armenia Philharmonic and Orquesta de la Comunidad de Madrid under the direction of such important directors as Mariss Janssons, Peter Maag, Jesús López Cobos, Vladimir Spivakov, Miguel Ángel Gómez-Martínez, Luis Antonio García Navarro, Vassili Sinaisky, Edmond de Stoutz, Gudni Emilson, and JoAnn Falletta.\n\nOne of his most productive relationships has been the one he has established since 1995 with the Armenian pianist Serouj Kradjian, with whom he has recorded the complete cycle of sonatas by Robert Schumann (Hänssler) and the record “Miniatures” (Malkrafon), a unique anthology of music for violin and piano written by Armenian composers. His extensive discography includes numerous discs for record companies such as BMG, Auvidis, Trittico Classics and Elite Music in a wide variety of repertoire.

        "biografia":"AC\/DC is an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1973. Their music has been described as hard rock, blues rock, and heavy metal, though the band refers to it simply as \"rock and roll.\" They are regarded as a significant influence on the new wave of British heavy metal and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003. With more than 200 million records sold worldwide, they are among the best-selling music artists in history.\n\nAC\/DC were founded by brothers Angus Young (lead guitar) and Malcolm Young (rhythm guitar), along with Colin Burgess (drums), Larry Van Kriedt (bass guitar), and Dave Evans (lead vocals). After several lineup changes, the band released their debut album \"High Voltage\" in 1975, which was issued only in Australasia. The lineup stabilized following the release of \"Let There Be Rock\" in 1977, consisting of the Young brothers, Phil Rudd on drums, Cliff Williams on bass guitar, and Bon Scott on vocals.\n\nSeven months after the release of \"Highway to Hell\" in 1979, Bon Scott died of alcohol poisoning. He was replaced by English singer Brian Johnson, whose first album with the band, \"Back in Black\" (1980), was dedicated to Scott’s memory and went on to become the second best-selling album of all time. Their next release, \"For Those About to Rock\" (1981), became their first album to reach number one on the Billboard 200. During the recording of \"Flick of the Switch\" (1983), Rudd was dismissed and replaced by Simon Wright, who was later succeeded by Chris Slade in 1989.\n\nThe band experienced renewed commercial success with the 1990 album \"The Razors Edge,\" their only studio release featuring Slade. Rudd rejoined AC\/DC in 1994 and performed on five subsequent albums beginning with \"Ballbreaker\" (1995). Their fifteenth studio album, \"Black Ice\" (2008), achieved their highest chart positions since \"For Those About to Rock\" and was the second best-selling album of that year.\n\nThe band’s lineup remained stable for two decades until 2014, when Malcolm Young retired due to early-onset dementia, from which he died in 2017. Around the same time, Rudd faced legal charges related to threats and drug possession. Malcolm was replaced by his nephew Stevie Young, who made his recording debut on \"Rock or Bust\" (2014). During the accompanying tour, Slade filled in for Rudd, while Axl Rose of Guns N’ Roses temporarily replaced Johnson after he was advised to stop performing due to hearing issues. Following the tour, Williams retired, and the band went on hiatus.\n\nIn September 2020, AC\/DC announced the reunion of the \"Rock or Bust\" lineup and released their seventeenth studio album, \"Power Up,\" two months later. The supporting tour was announced in February 2024, featuring drummer Matt Laug and bassist Chris Chaney as live members, while Rudd and Williams remain official members of the band.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/AC\/DC\n\nDiscography\nHigh Voltage (1975) (Australia only)\nT.N.T.

Both of them come from a mixed background; Love is of Iranian and Nigerian descent, and South is of Jamaican and Australian descent. (Georgia South's father, William South, is also a musician). They formed a band together in 2014 named BRAATS, releasing the song \"Bad Bitches\" under that name. Later that year they settled on the name Nova Twins, and released their first song \"Bassline Bitch\" under that name, in April 2015. That song attracted the attention of independent label Robotunes, which signed them and released their first self-titled EP in 2016.\n\nAfter a show at French festival Rencontres Trans Musicales in December 2016, Nova Twins spent most of 2017 touring multiple countries and supported Prophets of Rage, after which Tom Morello named them \"the best band you've never heard of\".

He rose to fame with his 2019 single \"Valentino\", which peaked at number 92 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was certified platinum by the RIAA in April 2020. In July 2020, Golden released the single \"Mood\", featuring Puerto Rican rapper Iann Dior, which topped the Billboard Hot 100 and became the highest charting song of his career.\n\nGolden's first music video, \"Trappers Anthem\", was released in 2017. In January 2019, he released the single \"Valentino\", which received over 100 million plays on Spotify. He received his first record deal through producer D. A. Doman. 24kGoldn got his big break through his 2019 \"high-energy\" single \"Valentino\". However, the rapper said in 2020 that \"those ['Valentino'] were recorded over a year ago and don't exactly reflect the person I have become since then\". Golden released his debut EP Dropped Outta College in November 2019, and he signed a record deal with Records, LLC and Columbia Records. In 2020, Golden gained further attention with single \"City of Angels\", which was officially released to US alternative radio on March 31, 2020; followed up in May 2020 with an official remix of the song by English singer-songwriter Yungblud. On May 20, 24kGoldn was featured on the remix of Olivia O'Brien's single \"Josslyn\".\n\nOn August 11, 2020, he was included on XXL's 2020 Freshman Class, placing in the 10th position after receiving the most fan votes. That same month, Golden's July 2020 single \"Mood\" featuring Iann Dior hit the charts due to its success on TikTok. It went on to peak at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n24kGoldn's music ranges from a variety of genres, motivated by his need to \"never want[ing] to be constricted by one genre\". Regarding his style, he stated: \"depending on what song you listen to, my music can be described different ways\". He attributes his \"maturity and development\" to rapper Paypa Boy, who initially got him into recording music.\n\n24kGoldn grew up in San Francisco, California and attended Lowell High School, a selective public school. As a child, 24kGoldn acted in commercials. Golden sang in the choir in middle school and high school, and, with that, the importance of music in his life grew with his \"own growth\". Before he realised he could do music professionally, he planned on becoming a hedge fund manager. Golden attended the University of Southern California where he joined the Beta-Sigma Chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, as a Spring 2019 initiate. He initially took a leave of absence from school to pursue his rap career. Golden stated that he was not anticipating \"that things were going to happen so fast when I came to USC\", and did not think he would finish University, but he wanted to round off the school year to further develop the relationships he made, stating his love for being on campus, and that being a student kept him \"grounded\". <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/24kGoldn\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

To accomplish such an achivement, they recruited the two most particular musicians they found: inimitable Juan Mariscal (bass) and matchless Adán R&R Maravilla (guitar).\n\nOnce the band is setup, La Maravillosa Orquesta shut themselves away in their garage to carry out frenzied rehearsal sessions. Finally, they got a handful of songs.

        "biografia":"Talking Heads was an American new wave band formed in 1975 in New York City, New York, United States. The band originally consisted of David Byrne (vocals, guitar), Tina Weymouth (bass) and Chris Frantz (drums), who had met while attending the Rhode Island School of Design. The band added Jerry Harrison (keyboards & guitar) in April 1977. The band released eight studio albums before disbanding in 1991. Talking Heads were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\nTalking Heads first appeared on the New York music scene as a trio in 1974. At the time, the band consisted only of Byrne and Frantz, and was initially called The Artistics. By 1975, the band had recorded a demo album for CBS Records and landed a gig opening for the Ramones at CBGB in June 1975, which was the first time the band used the name Talking Heads. The band was signed to Sire Records in late 1976 and the group released their first single, \"Love → Building on Fire\" in February 1977. In March 1977, the band added Jerry Harrison, formerly of Jonathan Richman's band The Modern Lovers.  \n\nTheir first album, Talking Heads: 77 was released soon afterward and did not contain the earlier single, although it did include the underground singles Psycho Killer and Uh-Oh, Love Comes To Town. Despite being regulars at New York's legendary CBGB, the band only began to break through further with the landmark Brian Eno-produced, 1978 album More Songs About Buildings And Food, an album which continued in the same vein, but with a more accessible style, wittier lyrics, and ultimately better songs. It was a great critical hit with subject matter ranging from home movies to the art world.  It also included their cover of Take Me To The River. On the following year's Fear Of Music the band started to dabble in African rhythms, notably on I Zimbra, and more straightforward pop styles, on Life During Wartime and Cities.\n\n1980 brought the band's fourth and most innovative effort Remain In Light. Notable for the single Once In A Lifetime, which became an early MTV staple, Remain In Light saw the band experiment with ambient sounds, fugal structures, polyrhythms, and about everything under the sun to make the body groove. Following this, the group split with Brian Eno, enjoying greater commercial success with 1983's Speaking In Tongues. It took the musical innovations of its predecessor and refined them into pop songs, most notably Burning Down The House, Girlfriend Is Better and This Must Be The Place. This period was topped off with a live album, from Jonathan Demme's documentary, Stop Making Sense. The documentary, with its name taken from a line in Girlfriend Is Better, was a great success, and took their inimitable style to a wider audience.\n\n1985's Little Creatures was an even bigger hit, and exhibited another stylistic shift for the band. It saw the punk styles of '77 almost completely abandoned for simple, three or four chord pop songs. The album produced the singles And She Was, and Road To Nowhere. The following two albums, True Stories and Naked, were both moderate successes, the former producing their biggest radio hits, Love For Sale and Wild Wild Life,  and the latter focusing more on Latin influences with hits like (Nothing But) Flowers.  After this, a long quiet period followed, with the band eventually officially announcing their break up in 1991. Since the split, Byrne continued his solo career and Weymoth and Frantz continued to record and tour as Tom Tom Club. Weymouth, Harrison and Frantz reunited for an album, \"No Talking, Just Head\", recorded under the name The Heads in 1996.\n\nThe band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. The band reunited for a three song performance at the ceremony. Due to personality conflicts between Byrne and the other members, further reunions are unlikely.\n\nwww.talking-heads.net <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Talking+Heads\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Wanda Jackson (born Wanda Lavonne Jackson, October 20, 1937 in Maud, Oklahoma) is an American rock and roll singer. Having made her debut recordings at the age of nineteen, she became one of the first popular female rock and roll singers in history and as a result, a pioneering and influential figure in female musicianship. She is known as the \"Queen (or First Lady) of Rockabilly.\"\n\nJackson was still in high school when country singer Hank Thompson heard her sing on an Oklahoma City radio show and asked her to record with his band in 1954. She dated Elvis Presley, who encouraged her to step away from the country-tinged gospel she had been performing since childhood and try her hand at rock and roll. She developed her own distinctive voice and performed in a variety of styles, from folksy traditional tunes to country twang and high yodels to throaty, suggestive ballads. She was a prolific singer of songs with wry lyrics such as \"Fujiyama Mama,\" which contained many references to the World War II bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; ironically, it became a #1 hit in Japan. Her biggest hit was 1959's \"Let's Have a Party.\"\n\nJackson achieved great and continuing success throughout Europe, Asia, and Australia, but has never found the same level of fame in her native United States. She toured with rock and roll pioneers such as Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Buddy Holly. She has been nominated for two Grammys, and has been awarded the Oklahoma Native Daughter Award. She has been inducted into the Oklahoma Country Music Hall of Fame, the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, the International Hall of Fame, the International Gospel Music Hall of Fame, the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame, and the German Country Music Hall of Fame, and in 2009 was finally inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as an Early Influence.\n\nA born-again Christian, Jackson and her husband\/manager Wendell Goodman abandoned rock and roll in 1971 and spent the next 25 years performing gospel in churches.\n\nIn 1996, Jackson was invited by alt-country singer Rosie Flores to duet with her on an upcoming album. The two were so pleased with the results that Jackson joined Flores on a handful of promotional club dates which were soon extended into a five-week North American tour. Jackson, plesantly surprised to discover that she and her songs were known by a generation of rockabilly fans her grandchildren's age, soon assembled her own band and returned to clubs and festivals, where she continues to perform.\n\nIn recent years Jackson has recorded with such artists as The Cramps, Lee Rocker, Dave Alvin, and Elvis Costello. 2006 saw the release of a new Jackson album, I Remember Elvis.\n\nIn 2009, it was announced that Jackson would start work on new recordings with Jack White. The resulting album, The Party Ain't Over, was released on January 25, 2011. It included a cover of the Bob Dylan rockabilly song, \"Thunder on the Mountain\" and the Amy Winehouse song \"You Know I'm No Good\". On January 20, 2011, she performed with Jack White on The Late Show With David Letterman and again on January 25, 2011, on Conan. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Wanda+Jackson\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Born Daniel Martín Garcia in Madrid in 1977, he regularly entertained his family with impersonations of his favorite singers as a child and received his first taste of exposure as a 14-year-old on the TVE show Rock Out. \n\nAfter attending the Cristina Rota and William Layton drama schools, he teamed up with guitarist Iván Ganchegui in 1994 to form El Canto del Loco, who went through various lineup changes before releasing their 2000 self-titled debut album. The band went on to become one of Spain's biggest pop\/rock acts, scoring four chart-topping albums, A Contracorriente (2002), Estados de Ánimo (2003), Zapatillas (2005), and Personas (2008), in a hugely successful six-year period.\n\nHowever, Martín simultaneously continued to showcase his acting talents, appearing on both the big screen in gay-themed comedy I Love You Baby, Bigas Luna's comedy Yo Soy la Juani, and Pedro Almodóvar's Broken Embraces, plus the small screen in medical drama Hospital Central, cop show Four Countdown, and sitcom Los Hombres de Paco. After El Canto del Loco decided to take a hiatus in 2009, Martín began work on his debut solo record with producer Bori Alarcón, the result of which was 2010's Pequeño, a highly autobiographical and deeply personal record written in the wake of his sister's death. It was a formidable success, hitting number one in Spain and spending more than 18 months on the charts. Three years went into the making of his second solo album, Dani Martín, which spent four weeks at number one in Spain and also charted in Mexico and Italy. Tour dates consumed most of 2014, culminating in the release of his live album Mi Teatro in October 2014.  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/+noredirect\/Dani+Mart%C3%ADn\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Loathe is an English metalcore band from Liverpool, England. Formed in 2014, the group consists of lead vocalist Kadeem France, guitarist and second vocalist Erik Bickerstaffe, drummer Sean Radcliffe and bassist Feisal El-Khazragi. They are signed to SharpTone Records and have released two EPs and three studio albums. Prepare Consume Proceed was released in 2015 and was re-issued in 2016 through SharpTone Records as the label's first release. They released their debut studio album, The Cold Sun in 2017, then a split EP recorded with label-mate Holding Absence titled This Is As One in 2018. Loathe released their second studio album I Let It in and It Took Everything on February 7th of 2020. Their third album, The Things They Believe, was released on February 7th of 2021. The band's works are often categorised within the metalcore genre with experimental elements. Loathe have been nominated for Heavy Metal Awards best UK breakthrough band and Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards best new band in 2018. In a 2020 poll by Revolver magazine, they were voted the third most likely contemporary band to break through into the mainstream. The band describes themselves as a conceptual band, as throughout all of their album releases they have been telling stories of fiction. Their first release, Prepare Consume Proceed, was said to involve a story about a tormented protagonist, who loses a loved one and is later killed by the end of the EP's run. With the release of studio album \"The Cold Sun,\" it tells a narrative of a violent post-apocalyptic setting, mixing themes of desolation with an overarching sense of positivity and heroism. The record supposedly tells a story of two protagonists who exist during this dystopian setting set up by in the album. Bickerstaffe has stated that they don't take influence from other major concept records and acts such as Thirty Seconds to Mars and Pink Floyd, making the remark: \"Our inspiration to create concept records mostly comes from wanting to create our own worlds within the music, almost like looking at the album as a book with separate chapters.\" <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Loathe\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"OIiver Tree Nickell is an American vocalist, producer, and filmmaker from Santa Cruz, California. He signed to Atlantic Records in 2017, after his song \"When I'm Down\" went viral. He blurs the lines between meme and music with his strange and hilarious online presence. \n\nThe Santa Cruz native is known for his wide-ranging creativity. Even by looking at his social media pages it's apparent that Oliver Tree's 'brand' is composed of equal elements art, humor, and originality. As as a vocalist, producer, and creative director of all of his audiovisual projects, Tree's unique style also translates to his ensemble. \n\nIn February 2018, Tree released his major-label debut EP Alien Boy, along with the double music video for “All That x Alien Boy.” Tree wrote and directed the debut, which took over nine months to create. He spent five months practicing freestyle Monster Truck jumping at the Perris Auto Speedway and performed all his stunts in the music video. \nOn December 7, 2018, Tree released his second music video, \"Hurt\", a single from his debut album Ugly Is Beautiful. He traveled to Ukraine to film the video, which he wrote and co-directed with Brendan Vaughan, an up-and-coming music video director. In the first week, the music video for \"Hurt\" reached one million plays while the song received significant radio play. \nOn April 11, 2019, Tree released his third music video, \"Fuck\", with the single being released on the same day. \nHis fourth music video and single, \"Miracle Man\", was released on June 7, 2019, with the video reaching 1.3 million views on the first day of release. \n\nOn June 12, he announced that he would give his final tour, \"The Goodbye, Farewell Tour\". \n\nOn March 25, 2020, Tree posted a message to his Twitter page, stating that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, his album would not be releasing on time and that all his future shows had been cancelled. This brought on the creation of the song \"Let Me Down.\" He apologized for the news and states he wishes to release the album within 5–10 years, but as of now “he’s officially not retired.” Although this was obviously satirical his album was delayed to an unspecified date.\n\nFinally on the 17th of July, 2020, the album Ugly Is Beautiful was released with 14 tracks, all produced by Tree.\n\nOn July 15, 2020, Tree announced in a Twitch interview with Anthony Fantano that Ugly Is Beautiful would be his last album and that he would be retiring his music career after its release. He cited the difficulties he had with his label in releasing the album as his reasoning, and said he'd pursue film making afterwards. This most likely refers to the end of \"Turbo\" character that Tree has been playing. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Oliver+Tree\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Pearl Jam is an American grunge\/alternative rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1990. The band's lineup consists of founding members Jeff Ament (bass guitar), Stone Gossard (rhythm guitar), Mike McCready (lead guitar), and Eddie Vedder (lead vocals, guitar), as well as Matt Cameron (drums), who joined in 1998. Keyboardist Boom Gaspar has also been a touring\/session member with the band since 2002. Drummers Jack Irons, Dave Krusen, Matt Chamberlain, and Dave Abbruzzese are former members of the band. Pearl Jam outsold many of their contemporaries from the early 1990s, and are considered one of the most influential bands of the decade, being dubbed as \"the most popular American rock and roll band of the '90s\".\n\nFormed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous band, Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with their debut album, Ten, in 1991. Ten stayed on the Billboard 200 chart for nearly five years, and has gone on to become one of the highest-selling rock records ever, going 13× platinum in the United States. Released in 1993, Pearl Jam's second album, Vs., sold over 950,000 copies in its first week of release, setting the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week of release at the time. Their third album, Vitalogy (1994), became the second-fastest-selling CD in history at the time, with more than 877,000 units sold in its first week.\n\nOne of the key bands in the grunge movement of the early 1990s, Pearl Jam's members often shunned popular music industry practices such as making music videos or participating in interviews. The band also sued Ticketmaster, claiming it had monopolized the concert-ticket market. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having \"spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame.\"\n\nPearl Jam had sold more than 85 million albums worldwide by 2018, including nearly 32 million albums in the United States by 2012, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. Pearl Jam was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017 in its first year of eligibility. They were ranked eighth in a readers' poll by Rolling Stone magazine in its \"Top Ten Live Acts of All Time\" issue. Throughout its career, the band has also promoted wider social and political issues, from pro-abortion rights sentiments to opposition to George W. Bush's presidency. Vedder acts as the band's spokesman on these issues.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pearl_Jam\n\nStudio albums\nTen (1991)\nVs.

        "biografia":"Bombay Bicycle Club are a British band formed in North London, United Kingdom in 2006. In January 2016, the four members announced that they would pursue solo projects. Ed Nash has since then been recording music under the name Toothless, releasing his debut album in early 2017, and former frontman Steadman has been recording under the name Mr Jukes, releasing a debut single in March 2017. \n\nThe band was formed by Jack Steadman (vocals, guitar, bass), Jamie MacColl (bass, guitar, banjo, vocals), Suren De Saram (drums) under the name of The Canals when they were 15. Ed Nash (bass, keyboard, mandolin) later joined the trio as they switched between various aliases before picking Bombay Bicycle Club. The band took their name from a chain of curry houses in the London Area and have released four studio albums, \"I Had the Blues But I Shook Them Loose\" (2009), \"Flaws\" (2010), \"A Different Kind Of Fix\" (2011) and \"So long, See You tomorrow\" (2014).\n\nAfter winning the opening slot at V Festival 2006 ('Road to V' competition) and also played Reading \/ Leeds Festival for the three years running, in Febuary 2007 they released their début EP The Boy I Used To Be. This was followed up in October with the release of their second EP How We Are. In mid-July of 2009 they released their first album I Had The Blues But I Shook Them Loose consisting of 12 tracks. The album peaked at number 46 on the UK Official Album Charts.\n\nIn Summer 2010 they released their second album, Flaws . A UK tour co-incided with the release of the album which - surprisingly - is an acoustic recording. Venues on the tour reflected this new acoustic orientation, which gained them a number 8 on the album charts.\n\nThe lead single from their third album, A Different Kind Of Fix was released on June 23, 2011 and peaked at  #40 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart in the United States, the band's first chart appearance in the country. The album reached the number 6 position on the UK album charts.  \nThe band added Amber Wilson to their live party as an additional keyboardist and background vocalist. Singer\/songwriter Lucy Rose also joined the live performances on vocals, after featuring on several songs from the albums \"Flaws\" and \"A Different Kind of Fix\".\n\nOn November 5th, 2013 \"Carry me\" was released as an advance of their fourth studio album through Island Records. \"Luna\" was the second single to be extracted from the album \"So long, see you tomorrow\" which coveted the band their first UK number 1.\n\nAfter a long 6-year hiatus, the band made a comeback in 2020 with \"Everything Else Has Gone Wrong\", their fifth record. The album was released on January 16th via Mmm... Records, with eleven tracks.\n\n\"We’re thrilled to say that our 5th album, Everything Else Has Gone Wrong, is out now.\n\nWhen we started discussing the possibility of making another record after our a few years away as a band, we said we’d only release an album if we were confident that it stood up to our previous work. We’ve ended up with an album we’re really proud of, and we hope you agree that it’s been worth the 6-year wait.\n\nRecording this one was definitely one of the most enjoyable recording processes we’ve had as a band. Working with John Congleton, we had an initial session in London in early Spring last year at Konk studio, where we’d done our first and fourth albums. We then went to LA in late Summer to record the majority of it with John. Spending 3 weeks in LA was an unforgettable experience for the four of us. It was the first extended period of time we’d spent together in a long while and reinforced what we’d been missing during these few years. We hope that positive energy that was there during those 3 weeks has translated onto the record.\n\nWe’ve touched previously on how the album is about the comfort that music can provide in times of need. Hopefully, this record can give you that escape should you ever need it.\n\nWe want to get to as many places as possible to play these new songs for you. Wherever you are in the world, fingers crossed we’ll see you soon.\n\nLots of love\nBombay x.\" <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Bombay+Bicycle+Club\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Luis Alberto Spinetta, also known as El Flaco Spinetta (January 23, 1950 -  February 8, 2012), was an Argentine musician. He was one of the most influential rock musicians of Latin America, and together with Charly García is considered the father of Argentinean rock. He was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in the residential neighbourhood of Belgrano. Since he was a kid he listened to all kinds of music: folklore and tango, and a little bit later, rock. As with almost every other rocker of his generation, The Beatles would change his life. In 1967, in the midst of a repressive political climate, he formed a band called Almendra with school mates.\n\nContrasting with the backwards and authoritarian government of General Juan Carlos Onganía, Argentina and specially Buenos Aires were undergoing a cultural blossoming, based on new art expressions; the new generation, the sons of the middle class, was immersed in an effervescence that would not reappear in Argentina until 1983. Spinetta was part and later an exponent of that blossoming and rebellious youth that would express itself both through the arms and the arts. Spinetta devoted fully to the latter path, although he briefly became involved with left-wing political movements.\n\nIt was 1969 and his band, Almendra, recorded their first album. The band started recording and playing intensely and it became successful almost overnight. Almendra composed its own songs and the lyrics were in Spanish (something radically new). The subtlety and beauty of their sound would be one of the milestones (maybe the first) of Argentine rock. After two albums that enjoyed radio diffusion and deserved fame, the band split. Spinetta composed and recorded a new solo album, but an inadequate environment (he would later say that the mood of Argentine rock and rockers of those times were too \"heavy\" and negative for him) and the vast changes that success effected on his life made him leave the country.\n\nAfter a lengthy stay in Europe, he returned to Argentina and formed a new band: Pescado Rabioso. It was destined to be as mythical as Almendra. With a far more powerful sound and expressing the tension in the streets of an increasingly violent Argentina, Pescado recorded its first album in 1972. It was both a continuation of the creative stream of Spinetta and a drastic change in the style of his music and lyrics. The band recorded a second album; although a third one carried its name, Pescado was by then dissolved; Artaud, recorded in 1973 and mostly a solo album by Spinetta, was a major breakthrough. Partly based on the writings of Antonin Artaud, Spinetta exorcised many of the demons of his past in this album. This process would open the door to a new era in his music.\n\nIn 1974 he formed a new band, Invisible. With his new band he recorded three albums; Invisible I, Durazno Sangrando (together with Artaud, hailed as his best album ever), and El Jardín De Los Presentes. With Invisible, he left the powerful and rough sound of Pescado; the new tunes were more harmonic, soft and mellow, yet his work remained essential and revolutionary. Following this line, he embarked on a solo project, A 18' del Sol, after dissolving Invisible in 1976-77. By then, ten years later after starting his career, his style had became a delicate amalgam of old and new; the old pop and (proto) heavy rock had merged with various elements of jazz and bossa nova. That unique flavour would become his style during the next half decade.\n\nAfter recording and editing a failed album in the United States in 1979 (the only album that Spinetta lamented ever doing), with lyrics in English and destined to the US market, Spinetta returns to Argentina and starts a prolific era: he would record two albums with a short-lived Almendra Revival (one with original songs and the other live), and embark on a new project: Spinetta Jade.\n\nSpinetta Jade would prove to be a successful and innovative band; Spinetta was joined by some of the greatest Argentinan musicians of those and all times to help him build the new sound he was building since Invisible. The product: a blend of jazz and rock that was unseen in Argentina and that escaped the boom of symphonic rock that reached both the world and Argentina in the early 1980s. These four albums, Alma de Diamante (1980), Los Niños que Escriben en el Cielo (1981), Bajo Belgrano (a homage to the neighbourhood where he grew up, 1983) and the unforgettable Madre en Años Luz (1984), represent a defined style as well as the footprints of Spinetta´s evolution. Towards the last two albums, the sound became a little bit more \"pop\", and embedded with electronic elements (samplers and synthesisers with \"artificial\" textures). Something worth remarking: the overpowering influence and fame of Spinetta in the Argentinian rock world was only equalled by that of Charly García. Many fans and critics shared the feeling that the two musicians represented antagonistic styles and values. To show otherwise, Spinetta and Charly (with their respective bands at the moment, Jade and Serú Giran) joined efforts and gave what was probably the most important show in the history of Argentine Rock.\n\nDissolving Spinetta Jade in 1984, Spinetta shortly engaged in an album to be made together with Charly; yet, this would-be mythical work was abandoned. Of this interrupted work, two songs remained: \"Rezo por Vos\" and \"Total Interferencia\".\n\nBy 1982, Spinetta had restarted his solo projects, and from then on would never leave them. Kamikaze (1982) puts together a number of previously unreleased songs (one gem is a very old song he composed in 1965 called \"Barro Tal Vez\"). In Mondo Di Cromo (1983) Spinetta prefigures the style of his solo projects during the second half of the 1980s. His new production, from 1986 to 1993, would include four solo albums (Privé (1986), Téster de Violencia (1988), Don Lucero (1989), Pelusón of Milk (1991)), a joint album with Fito Páez, another giant of Rock Nacional (Sólo la la la (1986)), and the soundtrack of the movie \"Fuego Gris\" (named after the film, 1993). It is hard to describe this collection of wide albums with a single adjective. The style, the sound, the themes that Spinetta picks and uses with the dexterity of a veteran musician are broad enough to encompass rock, pop, some tango, jazz and bossa; they all sound 1980s like; they all sound Argentinian and reflect the difficult years of the new democracy (1983 onwards) and the contemporary thought about Argentina that is being made. Hope and failure, they are covered with the Porteño melancholy maybe more than Spinetta´s previous work.\n\nAfter a long silence, produced mainly by Spinetta´s conflicts with the recording companies, he finally opens a new period in his music with his new band: Spinetta y los Socios del Desierto. Three years (1997-1999) and four albums later, Spinetta had created yet another legend in Argentinian rock. Two studio albums, the double Socios del Desierto (1997) and Los Ojos (1999) would bring along a new sound, much more dry and 1990s sounding. The band made an MTV Unplugged, Estrelicia (1998), that because of its softness and acoustic nature, wildly contrasts with their live album, San Cristóforo (1998). As Spinetta said at the beginning of the first concert, \"Fans de lo acústico, abstenerse\" (\"Fans of acoustic music, refrain\"). The speed and roughness of the sound recalls Pescado´s sound. Also, in 1998, Spinetta chose the featured songs and artwork of a Greatest Hits album called Elija y Gane, edited the same year.\n\nThe band dissolved quietly towards the end of 1999. Spinetta started a solo era that spawns until the present. Silver Sorgo (2001), Obras en Vivo (2002), a live album, and Para Los Árboles (2003) combine maturity with boldness. The changing and mostly tragic landscape of current Argentina powerfully affects the background of these works. In them, Spinetta has showed that his creative flame is anywhere but near of being extinguished.\n\nOn 23 December 2011 he published on the Twitter account of his son Dante that he was facing lung cancer. He died on February 8, 2012 in his native Argentina, at the age of 62. His ashes were scattered in the waters of the Río de la Plata, according to his last wish, next to the Memory Park built to remember the desaparecidos of the National Reorganization Process.\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Luis+Alberto+Spinetta\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Metallica is an American heavy metal band formed in Los Angeles in 1981 by James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich and later based in San Francisco. Known for fast tempos, complex instrumentals and aggressive musicianship, the group became one of the founding big four bands of thrash metal alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. The current lineup consists of Hetfield, Ulrich, Kirk Hammett and Robert Trujillo. Former members include Dave Mustaine, Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted.\n\nThe band achieved major commercial success with its third album, \"Master of Puppets\" (1986), which has been widely regarded as one of the most influential metal albums. The follow-up, \"…And Justice for All\" (1988), earned Metallica its first Grammy Award nomination. The self-titled album \"Metallica\" (1991) marked a shift toward a more mainstream sound and became the best-selling album of the SoundScan era in the United States, with more than 16 million copies sold. After exploring different musical styles on later releases, the band returned to a thrash-oriented approach with \"Death Magnetic\" (2008). Its most recent album, \"72 Seasons,\" was released in 2023.\n\nIn 2000, Metallica became a central figure in the legal actions against the peer-to-peer service Napster, contributing to broader discussions about digital music distribution. The documentary film \"Metallica: Some Kind of Monster\" (2004) examined the making of the album \"St. Anger\" (2003) and internal tensions within the band. Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2009. The band also co-wrote and appeared in the concert film \"Metallica: Through the Never\" (2013), which combined live performance footage with a fictional narrative starring Dane DeHaan.\n\nMetallica is among the most commercially successful music acts, with more than 163 million albums sold worldwide as of 2023. It is the third-best-selling artist since the introduction of SoundScan in 1991, with 58 million albums sold in the United States as of 2017. The band’s discography includes eleven studio albums, four live albums, twelve video albums, one cover album, two extended plays, 37 singles and 39 music videos. Metallica has received ten Grammy Awards and has had six consecutive studio albums, from \"Metallica\" through \"Hardwired... to Self-Destruct\" (2016), debut at number one on the Billboard 200.

        "biografia":"Jerry Lee Lewis (born September 29, 1935 in Ferriday, Louisiana, U.S. died October 28, 2022 in DeSoto County, Mississippi) was an American rock and roll and country music singer, songwriter, and pianist, as well as an early pioneer of rock and roll music. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 and the Country Music Hall Of Fame in 2022. his pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. His nickname is The Killer.\n\nLike Elvis Presley, he was raised singing the Christian gospel music of integrated southern Pentecostal churches. In 1950 he attended Southwestern Bible Institute in Texas but was expelled for misconduct, including playing rock and roll versions of hymns in church. Pearry Green (then president of the student body) related how during a talent show Jerry played some worldly music. The next morning the Dean of the school called both Jerry and Pearry into his office to expel them both. Jerry then said that Pearry shouldn't be expelled because \"he didn't know what I was going to do.\"  Years later Pearry asked Jerry: \"Are you still playing the devil's music?\" Jerry replied, \"Yes, I am. But you know it's strange, the same music that they kicked me out of school for is the same kind of music they play in their churches today. The difference is, I know I am playing for the devil and they don't.\"\n\nLeaving religious music behind, he became a part of the burgeoning new rock and roll sound, cutting his first record in 1954. Two years later, at Sun Records studio in Memphis, Tennessee, producer and engineer Jack Clement discovered and recorded Lewis for the Sun label, while owner Sam Phillips was away on a trip to Florida. As a result, Lewis joined Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash as stars who began their recording careers at Sun Studios around this same time.\n\n \nLewis' first recording at Sun studios was his own distinct version of the country ballad Crazy Arms. In 1957, his piano and the pure rock and roll sound of Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On propelled him to international fame. Great Balls of Fire soon followed, and would become his biggest hit. Watching and listening to Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis said if he could play the piano like that, he'd quit singing. Lewis' early billing was Jerry Lee Lewis and his Pumping Piano.\n\nLewis was a pioneer of piano rock, not only through his sound by also through his dynamic performance. He would often kick the piano bench out of the way to play standing, rake his hands up and down the keyboard for dramatic accent, and even sit down on it. His frenetic performance style can be seen in films such as High School Confidential (he sang the title song from the back of a flatbed truck), and Jamboree. These performance techniques have been adopted by recent piano rock artists, notably admirer Elton John. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Jerry+Lee+Lewis\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"There are multiple artists using this name:\n\n1. The Killers is an American rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2001. \nThey got the name from the fictional band The Killers in the video for New Order's song Crystal. \nAs of 2021, the band has released six studio albums, which have sold 28 million records worldwide. \n\nThe Early Years\nInitially, The Killers played at large clubs in Las Vegas. With the band's line-up stable and their repertoire of songs expanding, the band began to attract attention from talent bookers, local agents, major label, scouts — and a UK representative for Warner Bros. Though the Warner Bros representative passed on the band, he took the demo back with him, showing it to a friend who worked at UK (London-based) indie label Lizard King Records (now Marrakesh Records). The Killers then signed in the summer of 2002 to a British label.\n\nHot Fuss\nThey released their debut album Hot Fuss on June 2004 in the United Kingdom and US (on Island Records). Their first single was Somebody Told Me. The band also had chart success with their singles Mr. Brightside, which reached the Top 10 in the UK when released, and All These Things That I've Done.\n\nSam's Town\nThe band started recording its second album, Sam's Town, on February 15, 2006, at The Palms Hotel\/Casino in Las Vegas. It was released on October 2006. \nThe first single, When You Were Young debuted on radio stations in late July 2006. In late August 2006, it was offered as a downloadable track before the album's debut. The single then entered the chart on downloads alone at #5, and the following week on its official release went to #2 in the UK. \nThe video clip of the second single, Bones, was directed by Tim Burton. \nThe third single was Read My Mind. The video for it was filmed in Tokyo, Japan. \nThe last one was For Reasons Unknown, released in June, 2007.\nThe album sold over 700,000 copies worldwide in the first week of release, with a No. 2 debut on the United World chart. \n\nSawdust Compilation\nThe compilation album Sawdust, containing B-sides, rarities, and some new material, was released on November 12, 2007. \nThe album's first single Tranquilize, a collaboration with Lou Reed, was released on October 2007. The band also released their cover of Joy Division's song Shadowplay on the U.S. iTunes Store. The album contains songs Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town (a The First Edition cover), Romeo and Juliet (a Dire Straits cover), and a new version of Move Away (previously available on the Spider-Man 3 soundtrack). One of the tracks on Sawdust is Leave the Bourbon On The Shelf, the first but previously unreleased part of the so called Murder Trilogy, in which it is followed by Midnight Show then Jenny Was a Friend of Mine.\n\n(Red) Christmas EP\nIn 2006 Songfacts reported that The Killers were recognized for their work with Bono's Product Red campaign, which is dedicated to fighting AIDS in Africa. \nIn the same year they have released their first Christmas themed song and music video, A Great Big Sled in aid of the charity, followed by Don't Shoot Me Santa on December 1, 2007. \nTheir festive tunes have subsequently became an annual event and (Red) Christmas EP intended to raise money for the Product Red campaign on November 29, 2011.\n\nDay & Age\nThe third album Day & Age was released on 25th November 2008 (24th November for the UK). \nThe album's first single Human was debuted on 22nd September and on the 30th September, the single was made available on iTunes, with many radio DJ's suggesting it was the best single by The Killers yet.\nKillers frontman Brandon Flowers said (in December 2008) that he thinks that his band \"will be bigger than U2 eventually, and sooner than you might think\". He told The Daily Telegraph that \"U2 are unbelievable, but they're getting old. It feels like it's time\". \nThe album was reviewed at Silent Soundwaves.\n\nBattle Born\nThe band was on hiatus, but returned to the studio to record their fourth studio album in early 2011. Songfacts reported that Runaways, the first single from the new album, was released on July 10, 2012. \nThe Killers' fourth studio album, Battle Born, was released on 18 September 2012. \nIt took 15 months to record it. The band began working on it after they took a touring break for a little over a year. The album had five producers, with The Killers producing one song by themselves, The Rising Tide. \nThe debut single was Runaways, followed by Miss Atomic Bomb and Here with Me.\n\nWonderful Wonderful\nIn 2015, Brandon Flowers and Dave Keuning began to discuss recording a fifth studio album. The band recorded the album between September 2016 and May 2017, with production by Jacknife Lee. Band members Dave Keuning and  Mark Stoermer both announced that they would take a break from touring. The Killers' fifth studio album,  Wonderful Wonderful, was released on September 22, 2017, debuting at #1 on the Billboard 200. Stoermer\n\nImploding the Mirage\nOn November 15, 2019, the Killers announced their sixth studio album titled Imploding the Mirage for a Spring 2020 release. On March 12, 2020, the album's lead single \"Caution\" was released, featuring a guitar solo by former Fleetwood Mac guitarist Lindsey Buckingham. Buckingham said of the band, \"There’s such a strong center to what they’re doing. Their material is so well crafted that it cuts across a lot of generational lines.\" Brandon Flowers also confirmed that guitarist Dave Keuning was still on hiatus and did not participate in recording the album. On April 25, 2020, \"Caution\" reached number one on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart, setting a record of 13 years and 6 months since the band's last number-one song on the chart.\n\nThe Killers' sixth studio album, \" Imploding the Mirage\" was released on August 21, 2020. It debuted at #8 on the Billboard 200.\n\nInfluences\nMuch of The Killers' music is based on British influences and on the music of the 1980s, particularly New Wave. Flowers has also said in interviews that the larger-than-life sound of many of the band's songs is due to the influence of living in Las Vegas, a city where everything is about flash and who can top whom.

        "biografia":"Deftones is an American metal band from Sacramento, California, formed in 1988, consisting of Chino Moreno (lead vocals and guitar), Stephen Carpenter (guitar), Frank Delgado (keyboards and turntables), and Abe Cunningham (drums and percussion). Vega (formerly of Quicksand) took on bass duties from mid-2009 to ca. 2021 in substitution for Chi Cheng, who was seriously injured in an automobile accident in Santa Clara, California on November 4, 2008. Cheng remained in a coma until his death on April 13, 2013, due to cardiac arrest. Fred Sablan is their current live bassist starting in 2022. Lance Jackman plays guitar during non-US shows since Stephen Carpenter no longer travels abroad as of 2022.\n\nWhile they were mostly considered a nu metal band in their early years, their sound changed into something more complex and experimental in 2000, as a result, they are often coined today as an alternative metal band. \n\nCritics have often praised them as one of the closest to unique rock bands of recent years for their innovative, atmospheric music; as Johnny Loftus writes, \"Rock critics usually reserve a special place for Deftones above or at least away from the rest of the turn-of-the-century metal movement [...] Deftones have always seemed more curious, more willing to incorporate traditionally revered sounds like dream pop and DC hardcore into their Northern California alt-metal.\"\n\nFrontman Chino Moreno’s poetic lyrics—described by a Time magazine critic as “fiercely intelligent”—are often evocative, yet are sparse enough to allow for multiple interpretations. Moreno has cited Morrissey, Weezer’s Rivers Cuomo, The Cure’s Robert Smith, and Depeche Mode’s David Gahan among his favorite singers, and beyond an occasional similarity in vocal technique, these singers’ sweeping sense of drama and delicate vulnerability is often evident in Moreno’s vocals.\n\nDeftones members have worked on several side projects, including Moreno’s Team Sleep and drummer Abe Cunningam’s Phallucy. Guitarist Stephen Carpenter works with a group called Kush, featuring members of Fear Factory and Cypress Hill. Turntablist Frank Delgado has a DJ crew with DJ Crook of Team Sleep, DJ Julez, and Matt D called Decibel Devils.\n\n* Chino Moreno (vocals, guitar)\n* Stephen Carpenter (guitar)\n* Abe Cunningham (drums)\n* Chi Cheng (bass, backing vocals)\n* Frank Delgado (turntablist\/keyboardist\/sampler)\n\n(Carpenter is generally credited with “strings”, this title is used to refer to when Carpenter uses a distorted 5 string bass guitar most noticeably on the tracks \"Needles and Pins\" and \"Beware\")\n\nReleases:\n\n1992 - Like (Linus) - UnReleased Album\n1995 - Adrenaline\n1997 - Around the Fur\n2000 - White Pony\n2002 - Music in High Places: Deftones - Live In Hawaii (DVD)\n2002 - Back to School (Mini Maggit) (EP)\n2003 - Deftones\n2004 - Deftones extended-release for Tokyo Dome LIVE\n2005 - B-Sides & Rarities (with accompanying DVD video library and live footage)\n2006 - Saturday Night Wrist\n2009 - Eros (Shelved)\n2010 - Diamond Eyes \n2011 - Covers\n2012 - Koi No Yokan\n2016 - Gore\n2020 - Ohms\n2020 - Black Stallion (White Pony Remix)\n2025 - Private Music <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Deftones\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Robert Alan Deal was born May 4th, 1951 to parents Tina and Frank Deal. The second of five children, Robert was born in Huntington, Indiana where he would spend the earlier part of his childhood years. The journey from Robert Alan Deal to Mick Mars was a long one fueled by the determination of a man who just wanted to play.\n\nIt began one Christmas morning when Mick was 6 years old. His parents had given him a guitar. It had Mickey Mouse ears on the top and a crank that played Mousketeer songs when he turned it. Mick was by no means into \"mousketeer material\" so he tightened the guitar strings until it made a sound that was music to his ears. At just 6 years old, a musical genius was in the making.\n\nSundance, an older friend of Mick's from the neighborhood, gave him lessons. The first song he would learn to play on Sundance's guitar was \"My Dog Has Fleas\".\n\nA few years later, after the birth of Mick's sister, Susan, The Deal family moved to Garden Grove California. Frank worked at Menasha Container, the company that made cardboard boxes for Fender, while Tina ironed shirts on the weekends for extra money. Frank later found religion and became a Baptist Minister.\n\nAt 14, Mick joined his first band, The Jades. The Jades were a Beatles cover band in which Mick played the bass before replacing the guitarist. School was of no interest to Mick. When he attended, he was often in trouble for making music his priority instead of his schoolwork. Music was his life now and school had no place in it, so he dropped out.\n\n Mick moved into the shed behind his parent's house. Now, he could play whenever he wanted and as loud as he wanted and no one would say a word.\n\nOn a tip from a friend, 17-year-old Mick went to Fresno to play with a blues band that was looking for a guitarist. When it didn't work out, a disappointed Mick returned home to his parents only to decide later that he needed to be out on his own. Unable to afford a place of his own, Mick moved in with a group of bikers in Orange County.\n\nOne night at a party, Mick was introduced to a 16-year-old girl named Sharon. The two began dating right away, but Sharon wanted more of a commitment. Mick was 19 and his mind was made up, Music would remain his first priority. That would soon change when Sharon told Mick she was pregnant. Wanting to do the right thing, Mick married Sharon and they had a baby boy, aptly named, Les Paul.\n\nSharon got Mick a job at the Laundry mat where he worked during the day while he spent his nights playing after hour club gigs with his band Watoshi. In the mean time, Sharon gave birth to another baby, a girl they named Stormy. Mick quit the laundry mat after injuring his hand and told Sharon he would never work another day job again. Sharon took Stormy and Les and left, later having him thrown in jail for non-payment of child support. This was a major setback for Mick but it didn't stop him from trying to make his dream come to fruition.\n\n Mick would spend the next 7 years in and out of a band called White Horse. White Horse was a band that Mick saw play in Orange County. He persistently went to every show until they let him in the band. He moved in with the drummer and keyboard player, sleeping in a sleeping bag on the floor of their apartment that gave roach motel a whole new meaning. It was the bass player from White Horse that would give Mick an idea he would never forget when he coined the phrase \"well isn't this a Motley looking Crew\". Just as soon as he heard it, Mick wrote down the words Motley Crew and with a little play on the spelling, he decided that he had to have a band called Mottley Cru.\n\nMick had suggested the name to White Horse, and they Responded by voting him out of the band. Just before his exit from White Horse, Mick once again, became a daddy. Mick and his girlfriend Marcia, had a baby boy in 1976, they named him Erik.\n\nMick was back at square one. No band, no money and three kids to support. He played in a few bands that were spawn from former members of White Horse. Ten-Wheel Drive, Video Nu-R and Vendetta. Video Nu-R released two singles, Gypsy Woman and Decadence Plus, but they never took off. Ten-Wheel Drive later became Spiders and Cowboys. Now going by the name Zorky Charlemagne, Mick placed a classified add in The Recycler. It read: \"Extraterrestrial guitarist available for any other aliens that want to conquer the earth\". All it got him was a bunch of strange phone calls.\n\n Mick was playing at the Stone Pony with Spiders and Cowboys one night and after refusing to pay their price for tequila, he decided to take a walk down to the liquor store to get his own cheap bottle. Inside the liquor store, the guy behind the counter looks at Mick and says, \"You look like a Rock and Roller type\". After a brief conversation, Mick invites the guy to come and see him play. The guy, a kid named Frank from Seattle, went to see Mick play and afterwards they had a few drinks. Mick gave Frank his phone number, but there was no way of knowing if he even called, Mick went on tour with Vendetta.\n\nAfter returning from a tour of Alaska with Vendetta, Mick placed another add in the Recycler. The add read: \"Loud rude and aggressive guitar player available.\" This time opportunity knocked, and it knocked \"Louder than hell.\"\n\nMick received a phone call about a week after he placed that add in the Recycler. The person who called was Tommy Lee. Mick and Tommy had a brief conversation before setting up a meeting with the band. When Mick showed up to play with the band at a rehearsal, the bass player who had just left his band London, was the one who greeted him. His Name was Nikki Sixx. Two weeks after he had joined the band, it was Nikki who finally recognized Mick and he asked if he was the guy who had come into the liquor store and asked him to come to the Stone Pony. Frank, the kid from Seattle who worked at the liquor store was Nikki Sixx. \n\n At Mick's suggestion, the band got rid of their other guitar player. It was also his suggestion that they go after the skinny blonde kid who was playing at the Starwood with his band Rock Candy, to replace their current singer. With some pushing from Tommy Lee, Vince Neil accepted the offer to join the band. Now, with all the key players in place, Mick finally had his Mottley Cru. The only thing different was the spelling. With the addition of some umlauts, it became Mötley Crüe. There would never be another name suitable to fit Mick's new band, nor would there ever be another band capable of living up to that name.\n\nNikki worked at the Starwood during the day and managed to convince his boss to let Mötley Crüe play. The band played their first show together at the Starwood opening up for Y&T. During that time, none of the record labels were interested in the music that was coming out of the L.A. club scene. So, the band started a label of their own and called it Leathür Records. The band rented a studio for sixty dollars an hour and in just three days, recorded their first album \"Too Fast For Love.\" It wasn't easy to get the album out there but the band did eventually find a distributor and the album sold 20,000 copies within 4 months.\n\nOne night, Tom Zutaut who worked for Elektra Records happened by the Whisky when he noticed the marquee that read \"Mötley Crüe Sold Out.\" Tom entered the Whisky and after catching the show, went back to Elektra and persisted that they let him sign the band. Persistence paid off and Tom got his way. Mötley Crüe was signed to Elektra Records.\n\n Initially it was thought that the band would just re-release their version of Too Fast For Love on Elektra, but one of the reps thought it would be better if they remixed it. With the help of Roy Thomas Baker, the band re did the album and Elektra released it on August 20th, 1982.\n\nAs Mick had finally found the band that would bring him his much-deserved success, he still remains to this day one of the most underrated guitarists in the industry.\n\nMick's 20 plus year career with the band was far from uneventful. From a relationship in which he was abused to the point of attempting suicide, to being arrested in a case of mistaken identity after Tommy Lee had run down a Denver hotel hallway naked. His life would continue to be a roller coaster ride full of ups and downs. Mick battled depression; alcohol abuse and an addition to painkillers stemming from a personal health issue that he would confess to the world just after the band hit their 20-year anniversary mark.\n\nIn 1990, Mick married Nasty Habit Emi Canyn and in 1993 filed for divorce due to infidelity on her part. The divorce drained Mick emotionally and financially, but true happiness was waiting for him just around the corner.\n\nRobbie Mantooth, A documentary filmmaker from Tennessee, caught Mick's attention while working in the production office on one of the bands tours. After the tour, Mick phoned Robbie and made arrangements to visit her in Tennessee. When he returned home to California, Robbie came with him.\n\n On May 22nd, 2001, Motley Crue released their first autobiography entitled \"The Dirt\". The book is a basic insight into the formation of Motley Crue as well as personal depictions of their lives as told by the members themselves. It was the release of the book that brought out Mick's struggle with an incurable disease called Ankylosing Spondylitis.\n\nAnkylosing Spondylitis (AS) is the main rheumatic disease in a group of conditions called the spondyloarthropathies (SpA). Collectively, they are referred to as spondylitis. Ankylosing spondylitis causes inflammation of the ligaments and tendons that connect the vertebrae in the spine. This inflammation causes some damage to the bone, and the body heals this damage by growing new bone. This bony growth replaces the elastic soft tissue and can fuse the joints of the vertebrae. This fusion causes further stiffness and pain. Stiffness and pain usually begins in the pelvis and at the base of the spine and progresses upward through the back to the neck. It can also affect the hips and shoulders, the other larger joints of the arms and legs, and the heels. Ankylosing spondylitis is a relatively uncommon disease that usually strikes in the late teens and early adulthood. It can be mild or somewhat severe.\n\nMick was first diagnosed when he was 19 and kept his illness hidden, masking it with painkillers and alcohol. It pained him even more that the disease limited his mobility on stage and he could not interact with the fans as much as the other band members did. Mick is working with a physical therapist and with and support from his fans; he is intent on putting AS into remission so that he can tour with Motley once more. When that happens, it will be nothing less than Bittersuite.\n\nMick and Robbie ended their relationship in December of 2004.\nIn December 2004, Motley Crue also announced their reunion which includes a new anthology entitled Red White and Crue as well as a world tour kicking off on February 14th, 2005. Mick is presently on Tour as one of the original members of Motley Crue.\n\nOn October 26, 2022, Mars announced his retirement from touring with Mötley Crüe.\n\nA year later Mick Mars has unveiled his debut solo single which is titled “Loyal To The Lie” from his upcoming solo album 'The Other Side of Mars'.  The guitarist enlisted a crack team of musicians to help him along the way. A key contributor to the project was Winger and former Alice Cooper keyboardist (and, like Mars, Nashville resident) Paul Taylor, who, in addition to performing on the record and assisting Mars in co-writing many of the tracks, introduced the guitarist to powerhouse vocalist Jacob Bunton. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Mick+Mars\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

In the way that Rage Against The Machine briefs you on what they’re about before “Killing In the Name Of” can even grace ones ears, Sun Room achieves a similar effect.

        "biografia":"Avenged Sevenfold (often abbreviated to A7X) is a heavy metal\/hard rock band which formed in 1999 in Huntington Beach, California, United States. The band consists of vocalist M. Shadows, lead guitarist Synyster Gates, rhythm guitarist Zacky Vengeance, bassist Johnny Christ, and former Bad Religion and Suicidal Tendencies drummer Brooks Wackerman (2016-present). Heartbreakingly, the band's best friend and original drummer James \"The Rev\" Sullivan passed away in 2009. After The Rev's death, Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater fame and Arin ilejay replaced him.\n\nThe band has released seven albums since their formation: \"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet\" (2001), \"Waking the Fallen\" (2003), \"City of Evil\" (2005), \"Avenged Sevenfold\" (2007), \"Nightmare\" (2010), Hail to the King (2013), The Stage (2016), and most recently Life Is But a Dream… (2023).\n\nThe band was formed in 1999. Avenged Sevenfold's first album, Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, was recorded when the band members were eighteen years old. It was originally released on their first label, Good life Recordings. After lead guitarist Synyster Gates (also known by Brian Haner Jr.) joined the band, the introductory track \"To End The Rapture\" was re-recorded with Gates playing, and the album was re-released on Hopeless Records. Their follow-up album, entitled Waking the Fallen, was also released on Hopeless Records and was awarded a positive rating in Rolling Stone magazine. Shortly after its release, Avenged Sevenfold were signed to Warner Bros. Records.\n\nCity of Evil, the third album which was released on June 7 2005, strayed from metalcore, and instead headed more towards heavy metal and adds a harder rock sound with influences ranging from various bands. During the recording of City of Evil, M. Shadows' vocal styling changed to focus more on melodic singing rather than hardcore screaming. Some cite the change in vocal style as consequence of vocal chord damage (that resulted in subsequent surgery) during a tour supporting Waking the Fallen. Shadows denies the injury as being the reason. In the \"All Excess\" DVD, producer Mudrock clarifies this subject and affirms this is not the reason why the band changed style. He says \"One thing I see on the Internet, and that I just want to set the record straight on is, when I met the band, before they recorded Waking The Fallen, Matt handed me the CD [Sounding The Seventh Trumpet] and said \"this record is screaming, the record we wanna make is half screaming and half singing. I don't wanna scream anymore, but I'm going to make a record that's half singing and half screaming, and a record after that is going to be only singing\". The already knew they wanted to make a singing record right by the time City Of Evil came out, that was two years before it came out, that's what the band wanted to do as artists.\"\n\nThe band's name is a reference to the book of Genesis in the Bible where Cain is sentenced to live in exile for the crime of murdering his brother. God marked him so that none would kill him on account of his sin; the man who dared to kill Cain would have \"vengeance taken upon him sevenfold.\" The title of Avenged Sevenfold's song \"Chapter Four\" references Genesis 4:15, the chapter of the Bible in which the story of Cain and Abel takes place. The song's subject also appears to be this story. \"Beast and the Harlot\", yet another song derived from the Bible, comes from the book of Revelation only it is written in the first person and refers to the punishment of Babylon the Great, world empire and seat of false religion. Another Bible reference occurs in the song \"The Wicked End\". In the song, several times it is said \"dust the apple off, savor each bite, and deep inside you know Adam was right.\" making reference to Eve eating the forbidden fruit. Although the band's title and members' stage names make references to religion, Shadows stated in an interview that they are \"not really religious at all.\" \"Anyone that read the lyrics and really knew anything about us, they would know we're not promoting either\", he said. \"That's one thing about this band that I love is that we never really shove any kind of, like, political or religious beliefs on people. We just, the music's there to entertain and maybe thought-provoking on both sides, but we don't try to, like, really shove anything down anyone's throat. There's too many bands that do that nowadays, I think.\" \n\nThe song \"Bat Country\" is a reference to the book\/movie Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. The song is dedicated to the Author of the book, the late Hunter S. Thompson. Their song \"Blinded In Chains\" was used in the soundtrack for the video games Need for Speed: Most Wanted and Arena Football. \"Bat Country\" was used in the soundtracks for SSX on Tour, NHL 06 and Madden 06, following in the footsteps of \"Chapter Four\" which had also been on the soundtrack for NHL 2004, Madden 2004 and NASCAR Thunder 2004. The song \"Beast and the Harlot\" was in the soundtrack for Burnout Revenge. All the above games, not coincidentally, are produced by various divisions of Electronic Arts. \"Beast and the Harlot\" also appears in RedOctane's Guitar Hero II, released in November 7, 2006. The song \"Burn it Down\" is featured on the October 24, 2006 release of the Saw III soundtrack.\n\nDuring recent tours (Spring 2006 and Ozzfest 2006 tours) Avenged Sevenfold have been performing the song \"Walk\", originally by Pantera, as part of a tribute to the late Dimebag Darrell Lance Abbott.\n\nAt the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards, Avenged Sevenfold received the award for best new artist. They took the award over several other artists like Angels & Airwaves and James Blunt. After canceling fall and winter 2006 tour dates, the band is planning their unnamed fourth studio album. M. Shadows has stated that it will not be a City of Evil Part 2 or Waking the Fallen Part 2, because they want to change their sound once more. They say it will be somewhat of a surprise to their fans. Some people are rejecting their new sounds, as some are embracing it.\n\nThe band released their first DVD, Avenged Sevenfold : All Excess on July 17, 2007.\n\nAvenged Sevenfold, the band's fourth album, was released on October 30, 2007, debuting at No.4 on the Billboard 200 with over 90,000 copies sold. Two singles, \"Critical Acclaim\" and \"Almost Easy\" were released prior to the album's debut. In December 2007, an animated video was made for \"A Little Piece of Heaven.\" Due to the song's controversial subject matter, however, Warner Brothers only released it to registered MVI users over the internet. The third single, \"Afterlife\" and its video was released in January 2008. Their fourth single, \"Dear God\", was released on June 15, 2008. Although critical reception was generally mixed the self-titled album went on to sell over 500,000 copies and was awarded \"Album of the Year\" at the Kerrang! Awards.\n\nAvenged Sevenfold headlined the 2008 Taste of Chaos tour with Atreyu, Bullet for My Valentine, [arist]Blessthefall and Idiot Pilot. They used the footage from their last show in Long Beach for Live in the LBC & Diamonds in the Rough, a two-disc B-sides CD and live DVD which was released on September 16, 2008. They also recorded numerous covers, including Pantera's \"Walk\", Iron Maiden's \"Flash of the Blade\" and Black Sabbath's \"Paranoid\".\n\nIn January 2009, M. Shadows confirmed that the band was writing the follow-up to their self-titled fourth album within the upcoming months. They also announced that they will be playing at Rock on the Range, from May 16–17, 2009. On April 16, they performed a version of Guns N' Roses' \"It's So Easy\" onstage with Slash, at the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles.\n\nOn December 28, 2009, drummer James \"The Rev\" Sullivan was found dead at his home at the age of 28. Autopsy results were inconclusive, but on June 9, 2010, the cause of death was revealed to have been an \"acute polydrug intoxication due to combined effects of Oxycodone, Oxymorphone, Diazepam\/Nordiazepam and ethanol\". In a statement by the band, they expressed their grief over the passing of The Rev and later posted a message from Sullivan's family which expressed their gratitude to his fans for their support.\n\nThe band members admitted in a number of interviews that they considered disbanding at this point of time. However, on February 17, 2010, Avenged Sevenfold stated that they had entered the studio, along with now-former Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy, to drum for the record, in place of the Rev.\n\nThe single \"Nightmare\" was digitally released on May 18, 2010. A preview for the song was released on May 6, 2010 on Amazon.com, but was removed soon after for unknown reasons. Mixing for the album had been completed in New York City, and Nightmare was finally released worldwide on July 27, 2010. It met with mixed to positive reviews from music critics but was well received by the fans. Nightmare beat sales projections easily, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of 163,000 units in its first week.[45] After finishing recording, in December, Portnoy and the band posted simultaneous statements on their websites stating that he will not be their replacement for The Rev. However, Portnoy did travel with the band overseas in December 2010 for three shows in Iraq and Kuwait sponsored by the USO. They played for US Soldiers at Camp Adder, Camp Beuhring, and Balad Air Base. On January 20, 2011, Avenged Sevenfold announced via Facebook that former Confide drummer Arin Ilejay will tour with them starting this year. Whether or not he will be joining the band on a permanent basis has not been decided yet.\n\nAvenged Sevenfold performed at the Rock am Ring and Rock im Park festivals on June 3–5, 2011 alongside other bands such as Alter Bridge, System of a Down, and In Flames. On April 2011, the band headlined the Golden God Awards held by Metal Hammer. The same night the band won three awards for \"Best Vocalist\" (M. Shadows), \"Epiphone Best Guitarist(s)\" (Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengeance) and \"Affliction’s Album of The Year: \" for Nightmare, while Mike Portnoy won the award for \"Drum Workshop’s Best Drummer\" for his work on the album.\n\nIn May 2011, it was confirmed that the band had written a new song to be included in the Escalation DLC pack for Call of Duty: Black Ops. The song is the first time developers Treyarch have commissioned an outside band to contribute a song since the franchise began. The song, titled \"Not Ready to Die\", was released on iTunes on May 2, 2011.\n\nAvenged Sevenfold headlined the 2011 Uproar Festival with supporting acts Three Days Grace, Seether, Bullet For My Valentine, Escape The Fate, among others. In August 2011, vocalist M. Shadows stated the band would finish the Uproar Festival, then go home to take a break for six to seven months before starting a new record. He also roughly stated that Arin Ilejay and the band are getting along great, but that they have to make sure he's comfortable writing music with them, but also that he hopes everything works out.\n\nIn November and December, 2011, the band went on their \"Buried Alive\" tour with supporting acts Hollywood Undead, Asking Alexandria, and Black Veil Brides.\n\nOn April 11, 2012, Avenged Sevenfold won the award for \"Best Live Band\" and \"Most Dedicated Fans\" at the Revolver Golden Gods awards. The band toured through Asia into April and early May, and played at the Orion Music + More, Festival on June 23 and 24 in Atlantic City, New Jersey alongside Metallica and Cage the Elephant among many others.\n\nOn September 24, 2012, Avenged Sevenfold released a new song, titled \"Carry On\"; it was featured in the video game Call of Duty: Black Ops II. On November 15, 2012, vocalist M. Shadows said that the band had been working on a new album since the recording of \"Carry On\" in August 2012. The band began recording material for the album in January 2013. The band then started streaming snippets of the album in May 2013 on their new radio app. There, Arin Ilejay was confirmed as an official band member and replacement of deceased The Rev. M. Shadows said that the album would sound more blues rock-influenced and more like classic rock\/metal like Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin.\n\nThe band was confirmed to play at the 2013 Rock in Rio festival on September 22, 2013. On May 24, 2013, the band have announced dates for their European tour with Five Finger Death Punch and Device serving as their support bands.\n\nThe album, entitled Hail to the King, was released on August 27, 2013. This is the first Avenged Sevenfold album without any musical contributions from deceased The Rev. The album's lead single and title track was released on July 15, 2013. Hail to the King charted as #1 on the US Billboard 200, the UK albums chart, as well as the Finnish, Brazilian, Canadian, and Irish charts, and was commercially and critically acclaimed. The band will headline Monster Energy's Welcome to Rockville two-day music festival in Jacksonville, FL, April 26–27, 2014, joined by more than 25 rock acts, such as Motörhead, Rob Zombie, Chevelle, Korn, Staind, Alter Bridge, The Cult, Five Finger Death Punch, Volbeat, Black Label Society, and Seether.

Waking the Fallen: Resurrected was released August 25, 2014. The reissue charted #10 on the US Billboard 200.\n\nIn October 2014, M. Shadows confirmed that the band will begin writing their seventh album during mid-2015. In May 2015, the band posted a video on their website teasing their upcoming second live DVD\/documentary, entitled This is Bat Country, which will show performances from Download Festival, Rock in Rio and Rock on the Range. As of 2016, the band hasn't released the DVD because of the ongoing lawsuit with Warner Bros.\n\nIn July 2015 the band announced on their website that they would part ways with drummer Arin Ilejay, due to \"creative differences\". In October 2015, the band announced on their website that they had been working with a new drummer for over a year, making sure that it was a good fit before making sudden changes. On October 21, in an interview with Kerrang! magazine, guitarist Zacky Vengeance revealed that the band had been working on the new album for the past couple of months and that a couple of songs had already been completely written. On November 4, 2015, the band announced that Brooks Wackerman would replace Arin Ilejay as the drummer for Avenged Sevenfold. In an interview with Kerrang! magazine on December 3, guitarist Zacky Vengeance said that the new album went in all sorts of aggressive and melodic directions and described it as very \"aggro\".\n\nOn January 14, 2016, Billboard reported that Avenged Sevenfold had been sued by Warner Bros. for trying to leave the label. The band later released a statement clarifying that they wanted to leave because a majority of the executives who helped sign the band to Warner Bros were no longer at the label. They also revealed that the band was going to be entering the studio to record their new album very soon, intending to release it later in 2016. On March 31, the band posted a teaser of their upcoming album on their website.\n\nOn August 18, 2016, the band performed a free live show for 1500 people in Minnesota, marking it the first live performance with new drummer Brooks Wackerman.

On October 12, WWE Superstar and frontman of the band Fozzy, Chris Jericho posted an Instagram photo of the Deathbat logo with a date 12\/9\/16 underneath it. He then revealed the supposed title of the album, Voltaic Oceans,[83] It was later revealed that the new album would actually be called The Stage, a concept album about artificial intelligence, which was released on October 28, 2016 via Capitol Records. The album was released to universal acclaim, and the band decided to make a unique stage production for it, hiring Cirque du Soleil directors for its making.\n\nAvenged Sevenfold were announced as the main support act on Metallica's WorldWired 2017 stadium summer tour in the US, alongside Volbeat and Gojira.\n\n[TBC] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Avenged+Sevenfold\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Peter \"Hooky\" Hook (born February 13, 1956 in Salford, Lancashire) was the bass player for the English post-punk band Joy Division, and the new wave\/synthpop band New Order.\n\nHook was a co-founder of Joy Division along with Bernard Sumner in the mid-70's. Together, they recruited vocalist Ian Curtis and drummer Stephen Morris to complete the quartet. The band reformed as New Order following Curtis' suicide. In May 2007, Peter Hook announced that he and singer Bernard Sumner were no longer working together.\n\nBackground and bio:\n\nThe pioneering sounds of the highly influential English bands Joy Division and New Order were dominated by the droning basslines of Peter Hook. In the late '70s, Hook's ominous bass enabled Joy Division to carve portraits of profound despair. Although the late Ian Curtis' harrowing lyrics and downcast vocals are often credited for Joy Division's bleak beauty, many of the group's songs were driven by Hook's sinister, throbbing bass. While badly tuned guitars were the rage during the punk era in late-'70s England, Hook's bass playing instilled the importance of rhythm in punk rock, helping to inspire a generation of dance-oriented new wave bands.\n\nAfter Ian Curtis hanged himself on May 18, 1980, Hook joined the other surviving members of Joy Division in New Order. He performed the lead vocals on New Order's first album, Movement (\"Dreams Never End\" and \"Doubts Even Here\"), and his bass-playing style became increasingly melodic as the band developed its use of sequenced, synthesized sounds. He also played some keyboards and electronic drums. \n\nBetween the release of 1983's Power, Corruption & Lies and 1985's Low-life, Hook took part in the short-lived Ad Infinitum, an act featuring Lindsay Reade (then-wife of Factory boss Tony Wilson) and members of Stockholm Monsters; they released a cover of Joe Meek's \"Telstar.\" In 1990, after New Order released Technique, Hook formed a side project dubbed Revenge and released One True Passion. Collaborating with Dave Hicks (guitar, keyboards) and Chris Jones (keyboards), Hook combined elements of techno and hard rock; he also sang. A second Revenge album, 1992's Gun World Porn, was released before New Order resumed with the 1993 album Republic.\n\n\nWhile New Order went on an extended hiatus, Hook teamed up with vocalist David Potts (who had joined Revenge after that band's debut) and released Music for Pleasure as Monaco in 1997. Instead of shifting away from New Order's distinctive sound, Hook Xeroxed it; Potts even sounded oddly similar to New Order's Bernard Sumner. However, the album startled fans and critics with its well-crafted pop; the track \"What Do You Want from Me?\" even became a hit in clubs and on alternative radio stations. Monaco split up after label indifference temporarily shelved their self-titled second album; Monaco was finally released in 2000.\n\nHook remained restlessly active throughout the 2000s. He recorded two more albums with New Order (Get Ready and Waiting for the Sirens' Call) prior to leaving the band in 2007. He contributed basslines to recordings by a handful of acts, including Perry Farrell, Hybrid, and the Crystal Method. Freebass, a band he formed with fellow bassists Andy Rourke (the Smiths) and Mani (the Stone Roses) as initial members, issued a handful of EPs, along with a 2010 album (It's a Beautiful Life). \n\nPeter Hook and the Light were formed for the sake of performing Joy Division's two landmark studio albums, Unknown Pleasures and Closer, in their entirety, and were launched at The Factory, Hook's Manchester nightclub. In 2011, the band released an EP, 1102\/2011, which featured a version of Joy Division's \"Atmosphere\" with Rowetta on lead vocals. Unknown Pleasures: Live in Australia was released around the same time. Throughout this phase of his career, Hook also DJ'ed, compiled The Hacienda Classics and The Hacienda: Acid House Classics, and even wrote a book, How Not to Run a Club. He also served as an executive producer for the Hacienda Classical project, which transformed the hits played at the club into orchestral pieces in live shows and on the 2016 album of the same name.\n\nIn 2020 Hook was part of the Song Machine project, a web series involving the ongoing release of various singles and music videos by British virtual band Gorillaz featuring different guest musicians over the course of 2020. He was featured in the song “Aries\", also featuring drummer Georgia. The track was released on 9 April 2020 as the third single for Gorillaz' seventh studio album, Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez which came out in October 2020. He also played Aries with Peter Hook and Light in a quarantine cover of Gorillaz - this take on “Aries” features Hook’s distinct bassline, which is instantly recognizable for any New Order or Peter Hook and The Light fans. This performance gives “Aries” a nostalgic new wave feel, as Hook deliver soothing vocals on top of an infectious old school synth-pop instrumental with passionate choruses. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Peter+Hook\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"There are more than on artists\/bands by the name of Georgia.\n\n1. Multi-instrumentalist, producer and songwriter Georgia Barnes. Born and raised in a deeply musical household in north west London, Georgia combined music study at London's SOAS with a stint working on the counter at Rough Trade and quickly made a lot of very natural musical connections, being invited to play drums with DIY innovators such as Kwes and Kate Tempest.  Georgia herself is a warm, compelling, malleable voice as believable a sensual soul-bearer as she is raucous provocateur.\n\n2. The band Georgia has steadily created a loyal fanbase over the last few years.  Comprised of three brothers and a close friend all from the south, they are currently signed with Atlantic Records.  They released an EP called the Cabin Sessions Vol. 1, which was recorded live in 2007 while at a log cabin in Blue Ridge, Ga. They have since been working on their first full studio album, recording in LA.  More information can be found at www.myspace.com\/georgia or www.georgia.sunrise-promotions.com.\n\n3. A trance artist: Georgia is a female DJ \/ producer from Dutch harbour city Rotterdam. As of March 2008, she has two releases. Her first production was a track called 'We Rise', co-produced with 'Stimulator'. This was released in December 2007 along with a dub mix by her from the 'Flashover Recordings' label. Her second production 'Ode to '99' was released in March 2008 under the 'Levare Recordings' label.\n\n4. Georgia was the work of Patti Kim (Meowch \/ Tel Quel) and Five Seventeen (Toys for Elliot \/ 5MP) who carefully crafted songs with their 4-tracks in separate houses rather than walk the half-block to each others houses.\n\n5. Also a South African artist (or group).\n\n6. Georgia, real name Gordy Deems, was a lead \/ rhythm guitarist in the 80s AOR band, Rage n’ Rox. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Georgia\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Irreplaceable chemistry, maybe even magic, transpires between four musicians. The tried-and- true configuration of a four-piece rock band unlocks an endless array of possibilities. Nashville- based Betcha not only recognize such limitlessness, but they also leverage it. Ultimately, the quartet—Charlie Green [vocals, guitar], Ben Booth [lead guitar], Taylor Dubray [bass, keys], and Chase Wolford [drums]—breathe new life into this traditional ideal. On their 2019 debut for Atlantic Records, expansive vibes encompass sweetly stoned rock, electronic-backed alternative, and punchy pop anthems, evoking the power of four.\n\n“It’s such a staple to be a four-piece rock band,” exclaims Charlie. “You can literally name dozens and dozens of groups with this setup. Individually, it was something we all aspired to. It was our dream. We grew up loving these kinds of guitar-driven acts. It took a while, but we ended up with the right combination together.”\n\n“The best case scenario for all of us was to find four dudes who had the same taste in music and style,” adds Taylor. “Somehow, we made it happen.”\n\nIt began to happen in a dorm room at Belmont University…\n\nAs freshmen in 2015, Charlie and Ben started jamming together, writing songs, and filming acoustic videos. Both avowed Kings of Leon fans, the boys cold-emailed one of those D.I.Y. videos to GRAMMY® Award-winning producer Jacquire King [Kaleo, James Bay]. Impressed even at this early stage, Jacquire encouraged them to “keep going, get a band together, and send more music.” Throughout the summer of 2016, Charlie and Ben welcomed Taylor—who transitioned from guitar to bass in order to join—and Chase. \n\nStirring up a buzz on the college circuit, they won a Belmont University “Battle of the Bands” and performed anywhere and everywhere under the name Wilder. Soon, the guys found themselves in the studio cutting demos with Jacquire behind the board. Building a profile, a deal with Atlantic Records followed a standout 2017 gig at The End in Nashville. They went on to attract a growing fan base by cutting their teeth on national tours alongside Kaleo, NEEDTOBREATHE, Judah The Lion, and more. Rechristened in 2018 as Betcha—a combination of the first letters of their names (Ben, Taylor, Charlie, and Chase)—the members moved into a shared house and continued to evolve. \n\nWriting out of a basement work studio, hanging out constantly, and even attending the same gym, the musicians pushed each other creatively.  “We used to practice in a cold garage, plug in, and play,” recalls Ben. “Now, we try to switch up our creative process, so it’s not just bass, guitar, drums, and electric instruments. We’re incorporating more electronic-based ethereal elements. We really transitioned from Wilder to Betcha, and we’re grinding to make the best music possible no matter what is. It’s all under the umbrella of who we are.”\n\nThe band teased this next chapter with an acoustic take on the fan favorite “Losing My Mind” before dropping the 2019 single “Coincidental.” Powered by delicate picking, dreamy instrumentation, and bluesy crooning, “Coincidental” makes the irony of a bad first date catchy as Charlie sings, “Well, I heard you say, ‘Nobody lives in the moment’, and you went and spent the rest of the night on your phone.” As the drums kick in, the chorus takes flight over Ben’s nimble fretwork and melodic soloing.\n\n“I had gone on a date where the girl spent half the night on her phone,” recalls Charlie. “I started writing down juxtapositions and contradictory things. Musically, we were trying to think about what the song represented: hearing somebody say something and doing the exact opposite. It felt hectic. The guitar lick is chaos, showing the emotions of the narrator about these contradictions. It’s sarcastic, but there’s some hope behind it.”\n\nWith more music and touring on the horizon, the foursome ultimately tap into a spirit all their own.\n“Betcha is something you can listen to in any type of mood,” Charlie leaves off. “If you’re getting ready to hit the highway and need to fucking jam out, you can blast Betcha. If you’re feeling down and need something to vibe out to in your room, you can blast Betcha. We’re never going to limit ourselves. That’s our mindset, and it takes all of us to achieve it.” <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Betcha\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Rata Blanca played together for about two years before their debut on August 15, 1987 in the theater \"Luz y Fuerza\" in Buenos Aires, Argentina. They later took part in the \"Halley en Obras\", along with other bands: Alakrán (\"Skorpion\"), JAF and Kamikaze, in 1988. That year they made their debut album with two hits: \"Chico Callejero\" (\"Street Boy\") and \"El Sueño de la Gitana\" (\"Gypsy Woman's Dream\").\n\nIn 1989, Hugo Bistolfi joined the band and then Saúl Blanch left, to be replaced by Adrián Barilari. With that arrangement, the band made its second album Magos, Espadas y Rosas (\"Wizards, Swords, and Roses\"), containing their classic song \"Mujer amante\". It was followed by \"Guerrero del Arco Iris\" (\"Rainbow Warrior\"). The band ended their contract with Polygram recording a live album, made at the Opera Theater with an orchestra, but this album was released years later. Once in BMG they made a short CD called \"El Libro Oculto\" (\"The Hidden Book\").\n\nBoth Bistolfi and Barilari decided to leave, being replaced by Mario Ian on vocals and Javier Retamozo on keyboards. With this line-up they released Entre el Cielo y el Infierno (\"Between Heaven and Hell\"). Later that year, they were invited to play in \"Festival Monsters of Rock\" in São Paulo, Brazil, along with Ozzy Osbourne, Therapy?, and Alice Cooper.\n\nThey released yet another album with new singer Gabriel Marian and keyboard player Javier Retamozo (Hugo Bistolfi left to form the band Alianza with singer Adrian Barilari) called \"Rata Blanca VII\", the group disbanded in late 1997. They regrouped in 2000 (with Barilari back on vocals and Bistolfi on keyboards) to tour Latin America.\n\nIn recent years, they have released three more albums, El Camino del Fuego (\"The Path of Fire\") in 2002, La Llave de la Puerta Secreta (\"The Key to the Secret Door\") in 2005, and El Reino Olvidado (\"The Forgotten Kingdom\") in 2008. The lyrics to La Llave de la Puerta Secreta were inspired by The Da Vinci Code.\n\nWanting to gain a more international profile, Giardino approached former Rainbow singer Doogie White to record an English version of the Forgotten Kingdom album in 2009.\nThe band is heavily influenced by British hard rock bands like Rainbow, Deep Purple, Whitesnake, Iron Maiden, as well as by Yngwie Malmsteen.\nWalter Giardino has had successful collaborations with Spain's Mägo de Oz.\n\nThe band's name literally means \"White Rat\" in English; however in South American slang, rata blanca refers to a type of firework.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.rataweb.com.ar\/ <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Rata+Blanca\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The band opened for several major acts and released a series of EPs (Facedown, Sex, Music for Cars, IV) throughout 2012 before releasing their self-titled debut album (2013), which included the popular singles \"Sex\", \"Chocolate\", and \"Robbers\" and reached number 1 in the United Kingdom.\n\nTheir second album, 'i like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it' (2016), reached No. 1 in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Following the touring cycle for the record, the band announced their third album under the working title of Music for Cars, before going on hiatus again throughout 2017.\n\nReturning in 2018, the band announced that the album had evolved into their third campaign cycle, consisting of their third and fourth studio albums. The first, 'A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships' (2018), was released to widespread critical acclaim, and became their third No. 1 album in the UK. The second, 'Notes On A Conditional Form', was released in May 2020 and became their fourth consecutive No. 1 album in the UK. Two years later the band released their fifth album 'Being Funny In A Foreign Language' in October 14th 2022.\n\nThe 1975 has garnered acclaim for their relevant salacious lyricism and exploration of an eclectic range of genres such as pop rock, synth-pop, R&B, electropop, new wave forms of electronic music (such as UK garage, 2-step and ambient), and forms of rock music (such as shoegaze, post-punk and post-rock), as well as elements of jazz, soul and gospel. Their sixth album, possibly entitled God Inside My Body, could release some time in the future. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+1975\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Foxy Shazam is an American rock band from Cincinnati, Ohio, formed in 2004. The band consists of lead vocalist Eric Nally, guitarist Loren Turner, pianist Sky White, and bass player Daisy. After forming the band immediately recorded The Flamingo Trigger independently, then committed to an extensive national touring regimen. Shortly there after Foxy signed with Ferret Records and recorded their second album, Introducing Foxy Shazam, which was produced by Casey Bates (Chiodos, Portugal. The Man) and released on January 22, 2008. The following year, they recorded their first major label record with a multi-platinum record producer, John Feldmann. Foxy Shazam signed with Sire Records (a subsidiary of Warner Bros.) and released their self-titled major label debut in 2010.\n\nThe band name originated from a slang phrase used by students at Eric Sean Nally's high school, where Foxy Shazam meant \"cool shoes\". On February 7, 2010, their single Unstoppable was featured in Super Bowl XLIV.\n\nIn 2008, the band was named one of the 100 bands you need to know by Alternative Press. They toured with bands such as The Strokes, Bad Rabbits, and The Young Veins. In 2010, the band was placed on Spin's list of ten bands you need to know. Since then, they've appeared on TV programs such as the Daily Habit. Also in 2010, vocalist Eric Nally helped write songs for Meat Loaf's album, Hang Cool Teddy Bear.\n\nFoxy Shazam's first album, The Flamingo Trigger, is seen as a post-hardcore album, with some slight classical influences. The band more resembled peers such as Chiodos and The Fall of Troy. With their second release, Introducing, the band incorporated more genres into their sound, and even made ballads, though still with some post-hardcore influence. Their latest release, Foxy Shazam, has influences ranging from Gospel, Soul, and Glam Metal. The band continues to surprise fans by keeping itself original.\n\nA quote from lead singer, Eric Sean Nally: \"When I listen to a Foxy Shazam record I think of Evel Knievel, Bruce Springsteen, my childhood, Van Morrison, my old friends from high school I don't talk to anymore, Elton John, the '50s, '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s and beyond, Iggy Pop and my first kiss. One of my favorite things to do when listening to my music is to close my eyes and picture a crowd of six million people all chanting \"Foxy! Foxy! Foxy!\" The lights go out and my band walks on stage. It gives me goose bumps. It all makes sense to me. When you listen to our record, think of your favorite things, and it'll make sense to you as well. Foxy Shazam is not concerned with what category it falls into. We want to stand for our generation. We want to be the biggest band in the world. We want to be the Michael Jordan of Rock N' Roll.\"\n\nMany media outlets compare the band to Queen and Meat Loaf because of their use of theatrics and over-the-top lyrics. The band themselves have noted the similarities but believes that they are just all influenced by the same things. It's not always music that influences the band; it could even be a smell that triggers a memory.\n\nEric Sean Nally has said that an album that influenced him was Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill. The magazine Alternative Press has compared the band to bands like Queen, My Chemical Romance, and The Darkness, while also believing that the band has a very unique sound that should best be seen live. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Foxy+Shazam\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Conociendo Rusia es un proyecto liderado por Mateo Sujatovich. Desde el primer disco, homónimo, que la intención está clara: refundar la canción clásica argentina. Subido en los hombros de los más grandes, su manera de componer nos regala música\n\nque es familiar y novedosas a la vez.\n\nUna combinación explosiva. En 2019 Mateo vuelve quedar en boca de todos con “La mexicana”, un single que al ritmo de una ranchera rockera aborda el desamor y se sigue acercando al oido popular. Su búsqueda se profundiza en “Cabildo y Juramento”. Audaz e intensamente contemporáneo, el álbum es una radiografía de estos años, signados por una exaltación amorosa y una efervescencia juvenil que se escucha en cada tono del álbum. Conociendo Rusia se encuentra en un gran momento artístico y se posiciona como uno de los referentes más fuertes de la escena del nuevo rock argentino. En los últimos años se consolidó en Argentina con un público que no para de crecer.  Llevó sus canciones a México, se presentó en venues como Niceto Club (CABA), Studio Theater (Córdoba) y Guajira (La Plata) con localidades agotadas, y formó parte de los principales festivales del país como Lollapalooza, La Nueva Generación, Cosquín Rock y Rock en Baradero. Realizó un proyecto de streaming a través del cual llegó a distintos lugares del mundo como Europa, Estados Unidos y Latinoamérica.\n\nActualmente se encuentra nominado en 3 categorías de los Latin Grammys. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Conociendo+Rusia\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

With their heavy sound the band coined their own genre - Tundra Rock - inspired by the American Desert scenes of the '90s. Influenced by bands such as Kyuss, Elder and Black Sabbath, their music is both heavy and groovy at the same time, with raw vocals and thunderous guitars.\n\nGrowing up in a part of the country where high mountains and wild nature surrounds one, the group eventually came together in Bergen - coined by many as \"the music capital of Norway\". After their debut concert late 2017, the band got signed despite not having released any music.\n\nAfter building a following through extensive gigging in their hometown, the band started working on their debut album. In October 2019, their first single, Horses, was released on all platforms, to much acclaim. The Song premiered on national radio in Norway, with a notable Norwegian music journalist claiming it to be \"...some of the best rock he'd heard the last years\".\n\nTheir two following singles -  There is Nothing New Under the Sun and In My Mind's Desert - further contributed to the band's growing hype, with Spotify listing their music on their officila Stoner Rock playlist. Both Singles further showcased Slomosa's unique ability to merge heavy riffs with catchy songwriting, catching the attention of rock fans all over the world.\n\nIn late august 2020 the band released their much anticipated self-titled debut album Slomosa <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Slomosa\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

However, a chance conversation about the success of Youtube cover bands brought the two together.  Their mix of rocking guitars and electric cello created a unique dynamic, blending their love of rock artists like The Black Keys and folk bands like The Violent Femmes.  Working on  covers grew tiresome, and an emotional break-up soon inspired them to write their first song together.  The resulting music produced a youthful and chaotic frenzy of catchy melodies and raw instrumentals.  When they recruited professional gamer Luke Davis to add his stylish flair to the band on drums.\n\nIn 2024, Monteith was announced to be leaving the band, so Rose and Mullen, previously touring members, joined as full members in his place.

I began writing and producing music at my uncle’s recording studio and Adams became really good at guitar.  We started making songs together and we’ve continued ever since. Nowadays we spend our time hard at work making music, marketing that music, and putting together tik tok videos (it’s been such an amazing avenue to explore). We’ve spent the last year and a half producing, and curating our sound.  We want to make you feel nostalgic, inspired, and we hope to provide a few laughs along the way.

        "biografia":"Deep Purple are a British rock band formed in London in 1968. They are regarded as pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, although their musical style has incorporated elements of psychedelic rock, progressive rock, and blues rock over the course of their career. After beginning with a more psychedelic and progressive approach, they moved toward a heavier sound with the 1970 album \"Deep Purple in Rock\". Along with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, they are frequently cited as central figures in the development of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early 1970s. In 1975, the Guinness Book of World Records listed them as the \"globe's loudest band\" following a 1972 concert at the Rainbow Theatre in London. The band has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and has generated several related projects and spinoff bands, including Rainbow, Whitesnake, and Gillan.\n\nDeep Purple were founded by Rod Evans (vocals), Ritchie Blackmore (guitar), Nick Simper (bass), Jon Lord (keyboards), and Ian Paice (drums). This initial formation, later referred to as the \"Mark I\" line-up, recorded three studio albums before Evans and Simper were dismissed in 1969 and replaced by Ian Gillan and Roger Glover, forming the \"Mark II\" line-up. After collaborating with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra on \"Concerto for Group and Orchestra\" (1969), the Mark II line-up recorded the studio albums \"Deep Purple in Rock\" (1970), \"Fireball\" (1971), \"Machine Head\" (1972), and \"Who Do We Think We Are\" (1973), as well as the live album \"Made in Japan\" (1972). These releases contributed significantly to the band’s commercial success and influence. Gillan and Glover left the band in 1973 and were replaced by David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes, forming the \"Mark III\" line-up. This version of the band released the studio albums \"Burn\" and \"Stormbringer\" in 1974. In 1975, Blackmore departed due to musical differences and was replaced by Tommy Bolin. The resulting \"Mark IV\" line-up recorded one studio album, \"Come Taste the Band\" (1975). Deep Purple disbanded in July 1976, and Bolin died later that year from a drug overdose.\n\nThe Mark II line-up reunited in 1984 and released the studio albums \"Perfect Strangers\" (1984) and \"The House of Blue Light\" (1987). Gillan was dismissed in 1989 amid creative and personal differences and replaced by Joe Lynn Turner, who recorded one album with the band, \"Slaves and Masters\" (1990). Turner departed in 1992, and Gillan returned for \"The Battle Rages On...\" (1993). During the subsequent tour, Blackmore left the band again in 1993. He was replaced temporarily by Joe Satriani and then permanently by Steve Morse. The \"Mark VII\" line-up, consisting of Paice, Lord, Gillan, Glover, and Morse, recorded the studio albums \"Purpendicular\" (1996) and \"Abandon\" (1998). In 2002, Jon Lord retired and was replaced by Don Airey, leaving Ian Paice as the only remaining original member. The \"Mark VIII\" line-up of Paice, Gillan, Glover, Morse, and Airey lasted for twenty years and produced six studio albums. In 2022, Morse left the band after twenty-eight years and was replaced by Simon McBride.\n\nDeep Purple have received various accolades and recognition. They were ranked number 22 on VH1’s \"Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" programme, and a poll conducted by Planet Rock placed them fifth among the most influential bands. In 2008, they received the Legend Award at the World Music Awards.

        "biografia":"Under the moniker The Rumpled hides the Irish Folk-Rock band est. in Trento (Italy) in 2013.\n\nThe 6 pieces ensamble plays a unique combination of Irish Folk, Rock, Ska and Punk, with the traditional instrument pair made of accordion and violin (Tommy and Patty) taking the spotlight as main melody makers; add on top some massive guitars riffs (Davide) and an ever-thumping rhythmic section (Michele on Drums and Luca on bass) laying the foundation for the drizzled vocals of the front-man (Marco) and you’ll have an idea of the Rumpled sound, a very fresh yet authentic version of Celtic Punk.\n\nThe band’s discography sees in 2018 the release of the 11 tracks debut Album “Ashes & Wishes”, recorded and produced by Gianluca Amendolara of Black Dingo Productions (already involved in projects like The Rumjacks and many more), with the support of the Upload Sounds platform.\n\nIn 2019, the band released the EP Grace O’Malley, a work inspired by the legendary female Irish Leader and Bucaneer. Anticipated by the title-track single, the record has been positively welcomed by both the audience and the press, raking up more than 1 million plays on Spotify.\n\nAs for the Live side, all the studio works of the band have been followed by promotional tours in mainland Europe.\n\nThe “Ashes and Wishes” Tour took the band on more than 60 stages between Switzerland, France and Italy, while the “Grace O’Malley Tour” ended in September 2019 , after more than 40 live shows around Europe, with the band shaking the ground from festivals stages like the one of Roi Arthur of Bréal-sous-Montfort in France, which saw more than 43,000 ppl attending the event.\n\nAfter the 2019 Christmas release of “Let It Snow!”, cover of the famous tune performed by Frank Sinatra, the band also shared the “Rumplugged Series” on the official Youtube channel, a selection of acoustic performances showcasing some of the best Celtic hits spiced up the Rumpled way.\n\nThe band has also recently finished the recordings of a new studio work.\nThe TOSS THE COIN EP was released on 13 March 2020 and will be followed by the “2020 Saint Patrick’s Tour”, with the band sharing some of the best European stages with the Aussie Celtic Punk legends The Rumjacks. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Rumpled\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Ele continua baseado em Nashville, onde desenvolve sua carreira como artista solo e compositor ligado ao selo ADA, da Warner Music Group. Em termos comerciais, é um artista certificado pela RIAA, com canções que somam mais de 1 bilhão de streams e bilhões de visualizações em vídeos no TikTok.\n\nEm sua trajetória inicial, Tinnesz esteve ligado à cena cristã contemporânea, estudando na Belmont University e tocando com a banda Mike’s Chair, com a qual assinou seu primeiro contrato com a Curb Records. Posteriormente, decidiu se afastar da rotina intensa de turnês e concentrou‑se na escrita de canções, expandindo sua atuação da música cristã para o pop e o rock alternativo. Antes de consolidar a carreira solo, também passou por projetos de banda, como o grupo Wavorly, o que contribuiu para sua experiência no circuito alternativo.\n\nA sonoridade de Tinnesz é frequentemente descrita como uma fusão de rock alternativo, pop e música “cinemática”, com vocais intensos e produção voltada para climas épicos. Em entrevistas, ele cita bandas como Weezer, Nirvana e The All‑American Rejects, além de referências de hip hop como Outkast, entre suas influências musicais. Observadores também apontam influências temáticas vindas da espiritualidade cristã, de experiências pessoais com ansiedade, da vida familiar e de acontecimentos culturais contemporâneos, elementos que se refletem nas letras e no tom emocional de suas canções. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Sam+Tinnesz\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Poligamia was a pop band founded in Bogotá, Colombia in 1991 by Andrés Cepeda, Juan Gabriel Turbay, Gustavo Gordillo, Freddy Camelo,  and César López. The first three of them attended Colegio San Carlos and were expelled in mid-school. They finished high school at Colegio Emilio Valenzuela where they met Camelo and López and started playing together.\n\nTheir first album Una Canción was produced and released in 1993 by Sony Music, who signed the group as an award after it controversially won a local battle of the bands for local radio station Radioactiva, against rock band EL Zut. The winning song was \"Bailando sobre tu Piel\". \n\nThe album's main hits were: \"Desvanecer\" composed by Turbay, \"Una Canción\", \"Mi Generación\" and \"Beverly Hills\". The song \"Beverly Hills\" was composed at the time the TV-series Beverly Hills 90210 was popular in local television.\n\nTheir second album was released in 1995 under the title Vueltas y Vueltas. The main hits were \"Confusión\" written by Turbay and \"Fue Solo Amor\".\n\nThe final studio album was released in 1996, and it did not receive great reception from the audience nor it had any major hit.\n\nPoligamia decided to break up in 1998 because of the interest of each member to follow different careers in music and production. The farewell concert was programmed as the first in a festival with different bands from Bogota and was recorded as a live album named \"Buenas Gracias - Muchas Noches\" that included a live performance of the band's main hits and a new song named \"Hasta que venga la mañana\". Also, the album included a bonus track named \"Ciertas Cosas\". This song was lately re-recorded by Andres Cepeda in his first solo album \"Se Morir\"\n\nSony Music released a Poligamia greatest hits album in 2001. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Poligamia\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

It's a cinematic sound rooted not only in the Florida towns where the musicians first banded together as teenagers, but also in the anthemic live show that's taken flipturn from coast to coast. In the time since their formation, flipturn has mushroomed to reaches far beyond the walls of the Fernandina Beach garage they first practiced in. Built up by Dillon Basse (lead vocals\/rhythm guitar), Tristan Duncan (lead guitar), Madeline Jarman (bass), Mitch Fountain (synth), and Devon VonBalson (drums), the band is gearing up for the August 19 release of their debut album Shadowglow; a snapshot of a band caught halfway between youthful optimism and adult precision, with songs that target the head as well as the heart.\n\nWith over 60 million streams on Spotify alone, countless sold-out headline shows across the US, and tours with Mt. Joy, Rainbow Kitten Surprise and Wilderado, the band has more than proven their place in the indie scene. This year has seen flipturn join the prestigious lineups of Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, Shaky Knees, Hangout, SunFest, and Levitate. flipturn recently signed with Dualtone Records to further amplify the release of their debut project, joining their legendary roster of the likes of The Lumineers, Chuck Berry and Shakey Graves. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Flipturn\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

She grew up in a house where amplifiers and guitar cases were just as much a part of the furniture as chairs and tables, and when most kids are still singing nursery rhymes in the bathtub, she was traveling across North America in a 34 foot motor home, performing professionally in her family band, The Neilsons. Sharing the stage with the likes of Johnny Cash, Tami appeared regularly on television and radio, and at fairs and festivals, promoting The Neilsons independent CD, releasing 2 top 40 singles on the Canadian music charts. She also managed to score an award-winning music video for their single \"Windows to The Past\", which aired regularly on CMT. Then Tami met a boy who caused her heart to flutter and her feet to move to the other side of the world. She arrived in New Zealand, showcasing as the support act on numerous NZ tours, performing at festivals in NZ and Australia and on television and radio and releasing her debut solo album, “Red Dirt Angel”, which included the single “Sister Cash”, a duet with Joanne Cash. Now launching her second album, The Kitchen Table Sessions, her first single \"Cry Myself to Sleep\" was nominated for APRA \"Best Country Song\". Buzzing with raw energy and talent, her music is a hybrid of acoustic torch and stripped-bare alt-country. From haunting ballads of heartbreak and irony to foot-stomping, hand-clapping, harmony-infused numbers, her live performance is one to be remembered. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Tami+Neilson\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

It wasn’t until later that he was exposed to the local metal scene where he played at small clubs with his band. Later down the line he posted his first song, “Visuals,” to his SoundCloud in late April of 2016 under the name Vizion.\n\nEventually in 2018, under the name Lito Xantana, he posted Corpse Bride. The song done relatively well in his area and he would drop more songs until the release of A Cure For Anxiety. This is presumably what caught Internet Money’s attention and why he would link up with Internet Money producer Nick Mira, popular for his work with Juice WRLD, and XXXTENTACION . It’s here that POORSTACY would release his first career-landmark song make up. With help from the dedicated fans of the Internet Money team, the song was able to pull in over 35k SoundCloud plays in less than 24 hours.\n\nOn March 13th, 2020, POORSTACY released his album The Breakfast Club, some songs which were previewed on the Industry Plant tour with best friend\/fellow rapper and singer Iann Dior.\n\nOn October 8th, 2021, POOSTACY would release another album, Party at The Cemetery, after teasing it with the singles \"Children of the Dark\" and the album's title track, \"Party at the Cemetery\". He would tour the United States after the release of this album alongside Paris Shadows and GVLLOW. \n\nThroughout 2022, POORSTACY would be relatively quiet in terms of releasing music, only featuring on a few songs; PLVTINUM's \"TOXIC\", DE'WAYNE's \"DIE OUT HERE\", Kayzo's \"BOTTLE OF RAIN\", and Franke's \"Can't Relate\". POORSTACY would, however, release a single in collaboration with post-hardcore band L'exquisite Douleur (now known as The Requiem) titled \"Abuse me\", which was from an upcoming EP that POORSTACY had been working on. This EP would however never be officially released.\n\nIn May of 2023, POORSTACY was arrested for being involved in an alleged domestic abuse incident with his girlfriend. POORSTACY would later confirm in an Instagram Live that all charges against him were dropped.\n\nPOORSTACY wouldn't release any music throughout 2024, likely due to his ongoing legal and personal issues. In mid-2025, he would release two new singles, \"Parasite\" and \"Nothing belongs to you.\", with the promise of more music being on the way.\n\nPOORSTACY would pass away on November 29th 2025, committing suicide in a Boca Raton motel room. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/POORSTACY\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Green Day is an American rock band formed in Rodeo, California, in 1987, by lead singer and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong and bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt, with drummer Tré Cool joining in 1990. The band’s major-label debut, \"Dookie,\" released through Reprise Records in 1994, achieved commercial success, eventually shipping over 20 million copies in the United States, and has been credited with renewing mainstream interest in punk rock.\n\nBefore adopting the name Green Day in 1989, the band was known as Sweet Children. They were part of the late 1980s and early 1990s Bay Area punk scene centered around 924 Gilman Street, a club in Berkeley, California. Their early releases were issued through the independent label Lookout! Records, including their first album, \"39\/Smooth\" (1990). Green Day has primarily functioned as a power trio, with Tré Cool replacing John Kiffmeyer in 1990 prior to the recording of the band’s second studio album, \"Kerplunk\" (1991). Subsequent albums \"Insomniac\" (1995), \"Nimrod\" (1997), and \"Warning\" (2000) were commercially successful, with \"Insomniac\" and \"Nimrod\" achieving double platinum certification and \"Warning\" reaching gold. Their seventh album, the rock opera \"American Idiot\" (2004), gained widespread popularity among younger audiences and sold six million copies in the United States. The band released \"21st Century Breakdown\" in 2009, followed by a trilogy of albums, \"¡Uno!,\" \"¡Dos!,\" and \"¡Tré!,\" in September, November, and December 2012, respectively. The trilogy underperformed commercially compared with previous releases, attributed in part to limited promotion and Armstrong entering rehab. Later albums include \"Revolution Radio\" (2016), which became their third album to debut at number one on the Billboard 200, \"Father of All Motherfuckers\" (2020), and \"Saviors\" (2024).\n\nIn 2010, a stage adaptation of \"American Idiot\" premiered on Broadway and received three Tony Award nominations, winning for Best Scenic Design and Best Lighting Design.

        "biografia":"Black Stone Cherry is a southern rock band formed on June 4, 2001 in Edmonton, Kentucky, USA. They are signed to Roadrunner Records. The band is composed of Chris Robertson (lead vocals, guitar), Ben Wells (guitar, background vocals), John Lawhon (bass guitar, background vocals), and John Fred Young (drums, background vocals), son of The Kentucky Headhunters' rhythm guitarist Richard Young. Black Stone Cherry has released six studio albums and four EPs, and has charted fifteen singles on the U.S. Mainstream Rock Tracks charts.\n\nThey originate from Edmonton, Kentucky. Chris Robertson and John Fred Young, son of The Kentucky Headhunters' rhythm guitarist Richard Young, started to play music together early in their teens and Jon and Ben soon followed. Black Stone Cherry officially formed on June 4, 2001. They then took over the practice house that had been used by The Kentucky Headhunters since 1968 and began to record tracks. After the band finished recording, they returned to Edmonton for a homecoming gig in the gym of the local middle school, which was attended by 1500 people. After the band’s self-titled debut album was released, Chris's former school principal invited the band back to Edmonton to celebrate with a concert. As the band entered the town, the streets were covered with signs welcoming them back.\n\nIn July 2007, they released a second EP containing the song \"Rain Wizard\" along with two previously unreleased tracks.\n\nThe first live album by Black Stone Cherry was released on October 31, 2007 immediately following the concert at the Astoria in London. They joined Def Leppard and Whitesnake in the summer of 2008 for European dates.\n\nOn August 19, 2008 Black Stone Cherry released their second album, entitled Folklore and Superstition. Three singles from the album, \"Blind Man\", \"Please Come In\" and \"Things My Father Said\" have been released.\n\nIn May 2009, they supported Nickelback's Dark Horse tour.\n\nThe White Trash Millionaire Songfacts states that their third studio album, Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea, got an unexpected early release on the bittorrent tracker, Demonoid on May 27, 2011 due to an employee error at an unspecified Walmart. The official release date was May 31, 2011.\n\nThe band recorded a new album in fall 2013, through early 2014. Magic Mountain was released on 6 May 2014, reaching number five in the UK albums chart. The first single was \"Me and Mary Jane\"\n\nOn October 7, 2015, it was revealed that the band had signed to Mascot Label Group, and had begun recording the follow-up to Magic Mountain for a 2016 release. The album was recorded in the same location as the self-titled album; Glasgow, Kentucky. The album, entitled Kentucky, was released on April 1, 2016 and became their second consecutive #1 album on the Billboard Hard Rock albums chart.\n\nIn February 2018, the band released their first single, Burnin', from their new album Family Tree which released on 20th April 2018 through Mascot Records.\n\nBlack Stone Cherry's music style is often associated with bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Black Crowes, and Led Zeppelin to a lesser extent. While there are clear influences in Black Stone Cherry’s music, they have created their own style to a great extent. The musical tone and composition of Black Stone Cherry is very comparable to that of Brand New Sin and Zakk Wylde's Pride and Glory.\n\nThe song writing of Black Stone Cherry is often praised for great storytelling and delivering a strong message. For example, the song \"Lonely Train\" is about the effect on families when a relative goes to fight in a war. The song \"Rain Wizard\" is about a local legend of mysterious wisemen who could bring the rain in times of drought. \"Backwoods Gold\" is about a local man who ran moonshine out of the hardware store in the middle of Edmonton. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Black+Stone+Cherry\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Clutch is an American rock band from Frederick, Maryland, originating in Germantown, Maryland. Its four members met while in high school in Germantown and consider themselves a Frederick-based band where they write\/rehearse for every album\/tour.\n\nSince its formation in 1991, the band line-up has included Neil Fallon (vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboards), Tim Sult (lead guitar, backing vocals), Dan Maines (bass, backing vocals) and Jean-Paul Gaster (drums and percussion). To date, Clutch has released thirteen studio albums, and several rarities and live albums. Since 2008 the band have been signed to their own record label, Weathermaker.\n\nClutch (originally called “Glut Trip” and stemmed from “Moral Minority”) was formed in 1991 by Dan Maines (bass), Jean-Paul Gaster (drums), Tim Sult (guitar), and Roger Smalls (vocals) in Germantown, Maryland. Smalls soon departed and was replaced by Neil Fallon, a longtime schoolmate of the other members at Seneca Valley High School. The band quickly gained notice through constant touring. The 12\" single “Passive Restraints” on the Earache label was Clutch’s first commercial release, garnering attention from other labels. Their debut LP, Transnational Speedway League, was released in 1993. It was followed by a self-titled album two years later that gained Clutch mainstream exposure. The band moved to the larger Columbia label for the 1998 album The Elephant Riders. They followed it in 1999 with a self-released groove-based album Jam Room. \n\nOn April 28, 2009 Clutch released Slow Hole to China, a collection of unreleased tracks. \n\nOn June 10, 2012, the band released a new single, “Pigtown Blues”, on iTunes, backed with an acoustic version of “Motherless Child” from Strange Cousins from the West.\n\nOn March 16, 2013 Clutch released their tenth album Earth Rocker which entered the Billboard Top 200 chart at #15 giving Clutch their highest chart position to date. It would remain on the chart for a total of 5 weeks. The album also reached #4 on iTunes’ overall Top 100 album charts and was #1 in their rock chart. Earthrocker won “Album of the Year” 2013 from British publication Metalhammer, and was rated highly on many rock\/metal magazines’ and websites’ end-of-the-year “Top Tens”.\n\nIn an interview on January 7, 2015 with music and entertainment company 88 Miles West, Fallon stated that the band was heading to Dripping Springs, Texas, to record their upcoming eleventh album. Fallon states the venture to Texas was due to the relocation of record producer Machine, with whom they worked on Blast Tyrant and Earth Rocker, and who recently opened a new studio there. He stated in the interview that “Septemberish, give or take a couple of months” is when they hope to release the new album.\n\nTheir eleventh studio album is titled Psychic Warfare, and was released October 2, 2015. Fallon said the concept is influenced by science fiction author Philip K. Dick. “His general philosophy and questions have always crept into my lyrics, because I share an interest in it,” he adds. “On Earth Rocker, ‘Crucial Velocity’ was definitely a Philip Dick song for me. On this record, ‘X-Ray Visions’ certainly is.”. Gaster described the new material as more diverse than ever.\n\nIn April 2018, Neil Fallon announced through the radio station The Eagle Rocks that the band's twelfth studio album would be titled Book of Bad Decisions. The album will be released on September 7, 2018. The album was recorded at Sputnik Sound Studio in Nashville, Tennessee with producer and engineer Vance Powell. \n\nOn November 13, 2020 Released The Weathermaker Studios Vol. 1. A collection of re-recorded hits and 4 unreleased covers and songs. \n\nOn September 16,2022 Clutch released their 13th Studio album: Sunrise on Slaughter Beach. \n\nBetween 2004-2018 Clutch created  seven straight top 10 releases on Billboard’s Independent Album Chart. \n\n    Neil Fallon – vocals, rhythm guitar, harmonica, keyboards, percussion\n    Tim Sult – lead guitar\n    Dan Maines – bass guitar\n    Jean-Paul Gaster – drums, percussion <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Clutch\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Linkin Park is an American alternative rock band from Agoura Hills, California. The band's current lineup comprises of vocalist\/rhythm guitarist\/keyboardist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, bassist Dave Farrell, DJ\/turntablist Joe Hahn, drummer Colin Brittain, and lead vocalist Emily Armstrong. Shinoda, Delson, Farrell and Hahn are founding members. Vocalists Mark Wakefield, Chester Bennington & drummer Rob Bourdon are former members of the band. Categorized as alternative rock, Linkin Park's earlier music spanned a fusion of nu metal and hip hop, while their later music features more electronica and pop elements.\n\nFormed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, Hybrid Theory (2000), which became certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Released during the peak of the nu metal scene, the album's singles' heavy airplay on MTV led the singles \"One Step Closer\", \"Crawling\" and \"In the End\" all to chart highly on the US Mainstream Rock chart. The lattermost also crossed over to the nation's Billboard Hot 100. Their second album, Meteora (2003), continued the band's success. The band explored experimental sounds on their third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007). By the end of the decade, Linkin Park was among the most successful and popular rock acts.\n\nThe band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types on their fourth album, A Thousand Suns (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds. The band's fifth album, Living Things (2012), combined musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound, and their seventh album, One More Light (2017), was a substantially more pop-oriented record. Linkin Park went on a hiatus when longtime lead vocalist Bennington died in July 2017. In April 2022, Shinoda revealed the band was neither working on new music nor planning on touring for the foreseeable future. Two years later, Linkin Park was revived in September 2024, when they announced a new album, From Zero, to be released later in the year. They performed their first concert in a private studio and unveiled their new lead vocalist, Emily Armstrong, who also serves as the lead vocalist for Dead Sara.\n\nLinkin Park is among the best-selling bands of the 21st century and the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 100 million records worldwide. They have won two Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, 10 MTV Europe Music Awards and three World Music Awards. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium. Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade list. In 2012, the band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1. In 2014, the band was declared as \"The Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now\" by Kerrang!.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Linkin_Park\n\nStudio albums\nHybrid Theory (2000)\nMeteora (2003)\nMinutes to Midnight (2007)\nA Thousand Suns (2010)\nLiving Things (2012)\nThe Hunting Party (2014)\nOne More Light (2017)\nFrom Zero (2024) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Linkin+Park\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"La Oreja de Van Gogh (English: Van Gogh's Ear) is a Spanish band. The name of the band references the Dutch painter Vincent Van Gogh who allegedly cut off his own ear. It was formed in Spain in 1996, when guitarist Pablo Benegas, bassist Álvaro Fuentes, keyboardist Xabi San Martín and drummer Haritz Garde met at university.\n\nSan Martin was the vocalist until Amaia Montero joined the band by request from Benegas, just after he met her at a dinner party. Much later, the band played at El Concurso de Pop\/Rock de San Sebastián, at which they were discovered and later signed by Sony Music.\n\nTheir first album, Dile al Sol (Tell The Sun), debuted in 1998; it went to the top of the Spanish music charts, and won the Premio Ondas to The very best Album of the Year.

        "biografia":"Maldita Nerea lo forman Jorge Ruiz Flores a la voz y la guitarra, Carlos Molina al bajo, Luis Gomez a la guitarra y Sergio Bernal a la bateria. Con una media de edad de 25 años, este cuarteto de Murcia lleva bastantes años preparandose para el lanzamiento definitivo de su carrera. Todos han pasado por diferentes formaciones y proyectos hasta coincidir en Maldita Nerea. Todo ha sido cuestion de perseverancia, ganas de superarse y fe en sí mismos.\n\nPrimero empezaron dando pequeños conciertos en Murcia y continuaron con actuaciones en locales de Salamanca , donde Jorge se traslado para continuar sus estudios de logopedia, los primeros conciertos alli tuvieron un exito sorprendente. El publico empezo a disfrutar muchisimo en sus actuaciones y a llenar todas las salas en las que actuaban. Las maquetas del grupo pasaban entre los estudiantes de mano en mano y coreaban sus canciones en los conciertos. Poco a poco se convirtieron en unas pequeñas estrellas locales mientras estaban en la carretera todos los fines de semana viajando de Murcia a Salamanca.\n\nSu primer disco, \"Cuarto Creciente\", reproduce de la manera mas fiel posible la excelente atmosfera de las primeras maquetas del cuarteto, transmitiendo toda la energia juvenil que les ha hecho tan populares en los circuitos universitarios.\n\nEn dos canciones del disco han participado la conocida actriz Lucia Jimenez, descubierta en la pelicula \"La Buena Vida\" y con recientes exitos cinematograficos, y su hermana Rebeca, tambien cantante, que ha colaborado en los coros de 3 temas. La voz de Lucia Jimenez se puede escuchar en \"Te hablare\", un medio tiempo a dos voces de estribillo demoledor y un claro mensaje de optimismo; siempre hay que ver el lado positivo de las cosas. Seguro que se va a terminar convirtiendo en uno de los grandes exitos de este disco.\n\nLas letras de las canciones de Maldita Nerea tambien van a sorprender a los que ya han perdido la fe en el Pop español. Y, ¡milagro: no hablan solo de amor! Es reconfortante saber que tambien tratan otros temas, que sus canciones estan llenas de personajes que no siempre hablan en primera persona y que recurren a historias bastante diferentes de las habituales en el Pop español. El mejor ejemplo es el primer single, \"Mi Rey y Yo\", una cancion que exige una escucha atenta para no caer en posibles interpretaciones equivocas. Ante todo es un reflexivo sueño sobre el exito y el fin de las injusticias, y tiene un aire pacifista que resulta aun mas adecuada en estos tiempos que vivimos.\n\nOtro de sus temas de mayor exito instantaneo y con un aire muy años 80 es \"Cariño, yo Solo Quiero Llamar\". Tan solo es una cancion simpática sobre el tema que busca la sonrisa complice en el que la escuche. Es evidente que resulta muy facil de recordar y siempre acaba siendo la que mas corean en sus conciertos.\n\nEl album se abre con una de las canciones mas rapidas, ritmicas y contundentes: \"Se esta Haciendo Tarde\". Su estribillo demoledor y su estructura envolvente la convierte en uno de sus grandes exitos en directo, al igual que \"Ninguno de dos\", otra de las canciones estrella del disco, con una estructura de esas que nos recuerdan a los grandes exitos de la reciente historia de la musica nacional. \"Ninguno de dos\" es un tema que va ganando fuerza segun va avanzando para terminar con un duelo de reproches entre los dos protagonistas de la letra de la cancion. Por eso es logico que se haya recurrido a grabarla, como sorpresa al final del disco, con voces femeninas, la de Lucia y Rebeca, consiguiendo un resultado contundente.\n\n\"Cuarto Creciente\" es una historia muy sentida y profunda interpretada con mucha fuerza e intentando transmitir la mayor emocion posible. Su estructura ‘in crecendo’ le otorga un dramatismo y una tension muy adecuada para la letra.\n\nEn otros temas como \"Que no es Verdad\" tratan la frustracion de algunos estudiantes obligados a tener que tener que terminar una carrera a toda costa, aunque tambien hay hueco para los momentos mas intimos y sentimentales como es el caso de \"Seis\", toda una emocionante historia de desamor y ruptura.\n\nLo que sobre todo tiene Maldita Nerea es algo del sonido de los grandes grupos españoles que han triunfado siempre en nuestro pais. Oyendoles, uno se imagina perfectamente poder estar en cualquiera de los millones de baretos donde solo ponen musica nacional. Maldita Nerea tienen la suficiente mala leche e ironia en las letras como para no pasar desapercibidos entre tanto monton de clonicos y mutantes musicales. En tu mano esta el poder descubrirlo.\n \n\n\n\n\n                  www.malditanerea.com <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Maldita+Nerea\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

On April 8 after several years of touring Spain and other countries, they published their third album,La Deriva. In 2017 they publish their fourth album Mismo Sitio, Distinto Lugar.

        "biografia":"The Ronettes was a girl group of the 1960s from New York City, best known for their work with producer Phil Spector. They consisted of lead singer Veronica Bennett (a.k.a. Ronnie Spector), her sister Estelle Bennett, and their cousin Nedra Talley. Their defining album is \"Presenting the Fabulous Ronettes Featuring Veronica\" from 1963, and their most famous songs include \"Be My Baby\", \"Baby, I Love You\", \"(The Best Part Of) Breakin' Up\", and \"Walking in the Rain\".\n\nThe group's career:\nSisters Estelle (born 1941) and Veronica Bennett (born 1943), and their cousin Nedra Talley (born 1946), began singing together as teenagers in Washington Heights, Manhattan. Encouraged by their grandmother, they entered and won a talent show at the Apollo Theatre in 1959, as The Darling Sisters. Phillip Halikus saw their potential, became their manager, and promoted their early appearances at hops and charity shows.\n\nIn 1961, while standing in line at the Peppermint Lounge, they were mistaken for a singing trio that had not arrived and were ushered on stage. After performing Ray Charles' \"What'd I Say\", they were signed to appear regularly there and in Miami. Later that year, they danced in shows staged by disc jockey Murray the K, but, contrary to many sources, did not appear in the 1961 film Twist Around the Clock. They did get a record deal with the Colpix label, and, as Ronnie & the Relatives, released their first single \"I Want a Boy\". They also worked as backing singers for Bobby Rydell, Del Shannon, and Joey Dee & The Starliters. Renamed as The Ronettes, they issued several more singles with Colpix and recorded an album, unissued at the time, but had little early commercial success.\n\nIn 1963 they came to the attention of producer Phil Spector, who was looking for a new girl group to assume The Crystals' mantle. He was taken with Ronnie's voice and style, and signed The Ronettes to his Philles label. As Spector's new protégées, they were given a strong image as \"bad girls\", with beehive hairdos, heavy eyeliner, and tight skirts. Their first Philles single was \"Be My Baby\", co-written by Spector with Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich, and arranged and produced by Spector. It became a worldwide hit, reaching # 2 on the U.S. pop chart, # 4 on the R&B chart, and # 4 on the UK chart. The follow-up, \"Baby, I Love You\", had an even denser arrangement, featuring Leon Russell on piano, and backing vocals from Darlene Love and Cher, among others. It was slightly less successful, reaching # 24 in the United States and # 11 in the United Kingdom. The Ronettes also featured on Spector's album \"A Christmas Gift for You\".\n\nEarly in 1964 The Ronettes toured England with The Rolling Stones and met The Beatles. They continued to have hits with \"(The Best Part Of) Breakin' Up\" (# 39 U.S., # 43 UK), \"Do I Love You?\" (# 34 U.S., # 35 UK), and \"Walking in the Rain\" (# 24 U.S.), which won a Grammy for Best Sound Effects, the only one Spector ever received. However, their LP, \"Presenting the Fabulous Ronettes featuring Veronica\", only reached # 96 and other singles were less successful; musical tastes had moved beyond the girl group sound, and the Ronettes were unable to maintain their relevance. After criss-crossing the United States and Canada as one of the opening acts for the final concert tour of The Beatles, they disbanded at the end of 1966.\n\n\nLater events:\nEstelle Bennett and Nedra Talley each married and, in 1968, Ronnie Bennett married Phil Spector and retired from performance for several years. In 1971, under Spector's direction, Ronnie recorded \"Try Some, Buy Some\" for the Beatles' Apple label. This was her last charting record, reaching # 77 in the spring of 1971.\n\nIn 1973, as she and Spector were about to divorce, she returned to performing at Richard Nader's \"Rock and Roll Revival\" show at Madison Square Garden. Her new version of The Ronettes at that time included Denise Edwards and Chip Fields, and they issued two singles on the Buddah label.\n\nIn 1988, the original Ronettes sued Spector for nonpayment of royalties. In 2001, a New York court announced a verdict in favor of the Ronettes, ordering Spector to pay nearly three million dollars in back royalties; however, the judgment was later overturned on appeal. On February 11, 2009 Estelle Bennett was found dead at her home in Englewood, New Jersey. She was 67.\n\nAwards and recognition:\nThe Ronettes were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\nIt was believed that Phil Spector, in his capacity as a member of the Board of Governors, deliberately prevented the Ronettes (and Darlene Love) from being nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, although they had been eligible for a considerable period. The alleged reasons included the acrimonious divorce of Ronnie and Spector, in addition to the group having (unsuccessfully) sued Spector for back royalties. While Spector was awaiting trial on a murder charge and out on $1 million bail, the Ronettes were finally inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at the March 12, 2007, induction ceremony held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. Keith Richards, a self-confessed longtime fan, inducted the trio. Ronnie Bennett (Spector) and Nedra Talley performed \"Baby, I Love You,\" \"Walking In the Rain\" and \"Be My Baby.\" Estelle Bennett was present to accept her award but did not perform. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Ronettes\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Bee Gees were a musical group formed in 1958 by brothers Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb. The trio achieved significant success in popular music in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and later became prominent performers in the disco era of the mid-to-late 1970s. The group was known for their three-part harmonies, with Robin's clear vibrato lead vocals featured on earlier hits and Barry's R&B falsetto becoming a defining element of their sound in the mid-to-late 1970s and 1980s. They wrote and produced their own material, as well as songs for other artists, and are regarded as influential figures in pop music history. They have been referred to as The Disco Kings, Britain's First Family of Harmony, and The Kings of Dance Music.\n\nBorn on the Isle of Man to English parents, the Gibb brothers lived in Chorlton, Manchester, England, until the late 1950s, where they formed the skiffle and rock and roll group the Rattlesnakes in 1955. The family later moved to Redcliffe and Cribb Island in Queensland, Australia. After achieving initial chart success in Australia as the Bee Gees, they returned to the UK in January 1967, when producer Robert Stigwood promoted them to a worldwide audience. The Bee Gees' soundtrack for the film \"Saturday Night Fever\" (1977) marked a turning point in their career, influencing the mainstream appeal of disco music. The album won five Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year.\n\nBee Gees have sold an estimated 120 million to 250 million records worldwide, placing them among the best-selling music artists of all time and the most successful trio in contemporary music history. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, with the Hall noting that only Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Michael Jackson, Garth Brooks, and Paul McCartney had outsold Bee Gees at that time. With nine number-one hits on the Billboard Hot 100, Bee Gees are the third-most successful band in Billboard chart history, behind the Beatles and the Supremes. Following Maurice's sudden death in 2003 at age 53, Barry and Robin retired from the group after 45 years. In 2009, Robin announced that he and Barry had agreed to re-form Bee Gees, but Robin died in 2012 at age 62. Colin Petersen, a former member, died in 2024 at age 78, leaving Barry, Vince Melouney, and Geoff Bridgford as the surviving members.\n\nStudio albums\nThe Bee Gees Sing and Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs (1965)\nSpicks and Specks (1966)\nBee Gees' 1st (1967)\nHorizontal (1968)\nIdea (1968)\nOdessa (1969)\nCucumber Castle (1970)\n2 Years On (1970)\nTrafalgar (1971)\nTo Whom It May Concern (1972)\nLife in a Tin Can (1973)\nMr. Natural (1974)\nMain Course (1975)\nChildren of the World (1976)\nSpirits Having Flown (1979)\nLiving Eyes (1981)\nE.S.P.

However, the group disbanded somewhere along the way with Yuri remaining the sole member, and the result is a mixture of some of the band's songs and many of the tracks Yuri had been recording on his own.\n\nYuri decided to release the album as a double CD, even though the 22 songs could easily go on one disc. In his own words: \"'Done' is for everything that was coming to an end, which were many things in my life; 'Undone' is for all the new possibilities that came out of that.\" <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/+noredirect\/Pajaro+Sunrise\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Throughout their short but promising career they have released the LP Círculos and A los amigos. More tracks will be released soon.\n\nThis pair of musicians consider their music to be pop rock, although they don't really like to pigeonhole themselves into a single genre, as they consider that each listener has their own experience listening to them.

In fact, so many members of Brent’s extended family have musical ability that he can’t really name them all. Music was not only in his blood, it was played and heard in his home as a child and in the homes of most of his relatives throughout his youth. As this 24-year-old native of Americus, Georgia, would say, “It goes way deep.” Deep as it was, there was no way that he could know growing up that these same familial ties would lead him on a crazy journey that would take him from small town Georgia to the mean streets of LA and back home again, eventually landing him in Nashville, writing songs and collaborating with some of the biggest names in country music today.\n\nFor Brent Cobb, making music was not so much a decision but rather a calling. And his vision was as broad as his influences, ranging from rock greats like Tom Petty, Bob Seger and The Rolling Stones to folk icons Townes Van Zant and Bob Dylan to legendary stylists Otis Redding, Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash and Hank Williams. Throughout his teens, he was overwhelmed with passion for the music that would later shape him. When he took up the guitar at age 13, it wasn’t long before he was playing and singing for family and friends, eventually joining local cover bands and writing songs of his own. \n\nShortly after his 18th birthday, Brent was a pallbearer in his great-aunt’s funeral, along with his cousin, record producer Dave Cobb, who returned to Georgia from LA for the funeral services. Dave had recently completed country music legend Waylon Jennings’s son, Shooter Jennings’ first album. Unbeknownst to Brent, his parents slipped Dave a CD of some songs Brent had written and recorded. Within two days of returning to Los Angeles, Dave had listened to the songs, played them for Shooter and was on the phone to Brent, inviting him to LA to record what would become his 2006 debut album, No Place Left To Leave (produced by Dave Cobb and Shooter Jennings). \n\nThe album release contributed to Brent’s decision to relocate to Los Angeles in 2007. Having never lived outside of the state of Georgia, adjusting to big city life was a shock to his system. Landing a job in the art department for a film production company, he spent his days building sets and his nights trying to move his music career forward, all the while questioning whether L.A. was truly the right place for him. Six months into his stint, Brent got lost returning from the airport. Stopping to re-orient himself with his window down, he looked up to find a gun in his face. He was being robbed at gunpoint. It was time to move back to Georgia. \n\nPrior to his time in Los Angeles, Brent had fronted regional band, Mile Marker 5, in Georgia, occasionally opening shows for Capitol Records recording artist and fellow Georgian Luke Bryan. Bryan took an interest in Brent and generously made a handful of Nashville based introductions, which led him to Carnival Music where he’s been writing ever since. \n\nHis affiliation with Carnival Music precipitated a move to (a much more manageable city) Nashville, and he has since penned songs for several major label projects, including Kellie Pickler, The Eli Young Band, and Luke Bryan. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Brent+Cobb\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Willie Hugh Nelson (born April 29, 1933) is an American musician, actor, and activist. The critical success of the album Shotgun Willie (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of Red Headed Stranger (1975) and Stardust (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana.\n\nBorn during the Great Depression and raised by his grandparents, Nelson wrote his first song at age seven and joined his first band at ten. During high school, he toured locally with the Bohemian Polka as their lead singer and guitar player. After graduating from high school in 1950, he joined the U.S. Air Force but was later discharged due to back problems. After his return, Nelson attended Baylor University for two years but dropped out because he was succeeding in music. During this time, he worked as a disc jockey in Texas radio stations and a singer in honky-tonks. Nelson moved to Vancouver, Washington, where he wrote \"Family Bible\" and recorded the song \"Lumberjack\" in 1956. He also worked as a disc jockey at various radio stations in Vancouver and nearby Portland, Oregon. In 1958, he moved to Houston, Texas, after signing a contract with D Records. He sang at the Esquire Ballroom weekly and he worked as a disk jockey. During that time, he wrote songs that would become country standards, including \"Funny How Time Slips Away\", \"Hello Walls\", \"Pretty Paper\", and \"Crazy\". In 1960 he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and later signed a publishing contract with Pamper Music which allowed him to join Ray Price's band as a bassist. In 1962, he recorded his first album, ...And Then I Wrote. Due to this success, Nelson signed in 1964 with RCA Victor and joined the Grand Ole Opry the following year. After mid-chart hits in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, Nelson retired in 1972 and moved to Austin, Texas. The ongoing music scene of Austin motivated Nelson to return from retirement, performing frequently at the Armadillo World Headquarters.\n\nIn 1973, after signing with Atlantic Records, Nelson turned to outlaw country, including albums such as Shotgun Willie and Phases and Stages. In 1975, he switched to Columbia Records, where he recorded the critically acclaimed album Red Headed Stranger. The same year, he recorded another outlaw country album, Wanted! The Outlaws, along with Waylon Jennings, Jessi Colter, and Tompall Glaser. During the mid-1980s, while creating hit albums like Honeysuckle Rose and recording hit songs like \"On the Road Again\", \"To All the Girls I've Loved Before\", and \"Pancho and Lefty\", he joined the country supergroup The Highwaymen, along with fellow singers Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, and Kris Kristofferson.\n\nIn 1990, Nelson's assets were seized by the Internal Revenue Service, which claimed that he owed $32 million. The difficulty of paying his outstanding debt was aggravated by weak investments he had made during the 1980s. In 1992, Nelson released The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?; the profits of the double album—destined to the IRS—and the auction of Nelson's assets cleared his debt. During the 1990s and 2000s, Nelson continued touring extensively, and released albums every year. Reviews ranged from positive to mixed. He explored genres such as reggae, blues, jazz, and folk.\n\nNelson made his first movie appearance in the 1979 film The Electric Horseman, followed by other appearances in movies and on television. Nelson is a major liberal activist and the co-chair of the advisory board of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), which is in favor of marijuana legalization. On the environmental front, Nelson owns the bio-diesel brand Willie Nelson Biodiesel, which is made from vegetable oil. Nelson is also the honorary chairman of the advisory board of the Texas Music Project, the official music charity of the state of Texas.\n\nNelson uses a variety of music styles to create his own distinctive blend of country music, a hybrid of jazz, pop, blues, rock and folk. His \"unique sound\", which uses a \"relaxed, behind-the-beat singing style and gut-string guitar\" and his \"nasal voice and jazzy, off-center phrasing\", has been responsible for his wide appeal, and has made him a \"vital icon in country music\", influencing the \"new country, new traditionalist, and alternative country movements of the 1980s and 1990s\".\n\nIn 1969, the Baldwin company gave Nelson an amplifier and guitar with their \"Prismatone\" pickup. During a show in Helotes, Texas, Nelson left the guitar on the floor of the stage, and it was later stepped on by a drunk man. He sent it to be repaired in Nashville by Shot Jackson, who told Nelson that the damage was too great. Jackson offered him a Martin N-20 Classical guitar, and, at Nelson's request, moved the pickup to the Martin. Nelson purchased the guitar unseen for $750 and named it after Roy Rogers' horse \"Trigger\". The next year Nelson rescued the guitar from his burning ranch.\n\nConstant strumming with a guitar pick over the decades has worn a large sweeping hole into the guitar's body near the sound hole—the N-20 has no pick-guard since classical guitars are meant to be played fingerstyle instead of with picks. Its soundboard has been signed by over a hundred of Nelson's friends and associates, ranging from fellow musicians to lawyers and football coaches. The first signature on the guitar was Leon Russell's, who asked Nelson initially to sign his guitar. When Nelson was about to sign it with a marker, Russell requested him to scratch it instead, explaining that the guitar would be more valuable in the future. Interested in the concept, Nelson requested Russell to also sign his guitar. In 1991, during his process with the IRS, Nelson was worried that Trigger could be auctioned off, stating: \"When Trigger goes, I'll quit\". He asked his daughter, Lana, to take the guitar from the studio before any IRS agent arrived there, and then deliver it to him in Maui. Nelson then concealed the guitar in his manager's house until his debt was paid off in 1993.\n\nNelson is widely recognized as an American icon. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1993, and he received the Kennedy Center Honors in 1998. In 2011, Nelson was inducted to the National Agricultural Hall of Fame, for his labor in Farm Aid and other fund raisers to benefit farmers. In 2015 Nelson won the Gershwin Prize, the lifetime award of the Library of Congress. In 2018 The Texas Institute of Letters inducted him among its members for his songwriting. He was included by Rolling Stone on its 100 Greatest Singers and 100 Greatest Guitarists lists. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Willie+Nelson\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Glass Animals is an English electronic\/alternative rock band formed in Oxford in 2010. The band's line-up consists of Dave Bayley (vocals, guitar, keyboards, drums, songwriting), Drew MacFarlane (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), Edmund Irwin-Singer (bass, keyboards, backing vocals), and Joe Seaward (drums).\n\nAll four members of the band met at St Edward's School in Oxford. Dave Bayley attended St Edward's on a music scholarship and was introduced to Drew MacFarlane, who would become the band's guitarist and backing vocalist; the two bonded over the fact that they were both Britons who had spent their childhoods in the U.S. MacFarlane then introduced Bayley to Edmund Irwin-Singer, the band's bassist, and Joe Seaward, its drummer. They began playing together as a group in 2010.\n\nOn 28 May 2012, the band released their debut EP Leaflings, which included the single \"Cocoa Hooves\". The EP was released on independent label Kaya Kaya Records, a subsidiary and imprint of XL Recordings (part of the Beggars Group of labels).\n\nIn 2014, the band made their first tour of the U.S. and performed at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. They released three more singles: \"Gooey\", \"Pools\", and \"Hazey\", along with a collaboration with Argentine singer-songwriter and producer Tei Shi. All five singles were included on the band's debut album, Zaba, which was released on 6 June 2014. The band performed the single \"Gooey\" on Late Night with Seth Meyers on 9 October 2014 and again on Late Show with David Letterman on 24 February 2015, and toured extensively after Zaba, visiting both hemispheres and playing over 130 shows in 2015 alone. Their October 2015 US tour included two sold-out shows at The Wiltern in LA and sold-out shows across America including T5 in NYC, The Riverside in Milwaukee, and the Midland Theatre in Kansas City. \"Gooey\" went on to be certified platinum in the U.S., cementing the band’s foothold in the alternative music scene.\n\nTheir second album, How to Be a Human Being (2016), won two MPG Awards for UK Album of the Year and Self Producing Artist of the Year and was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize. The concept behind the album, in which each song tells a story inspired by fictional characters, allowed the band to explore various musical styles and themes, contributing to its widespread acclaim.\n\nThe band's third album, Dreamland (2020), marked a more introspective turn, as Bayley delved into personal themes, touching on nostalgia and memory. Dreamland reached number two on the UK Albums Chart and number seven on the US Billboard 200, driven in part by the massive success of “Heat Waves.” The song, which became a global hit through TikTok, eventually topped charts worldwide, including the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and achieved over two billion Spotify streams by 2022. The album was promoted with singles like “Tokyo Drifting” featuring rapper Denzel Curry and “Your Love (Déjà Vu)”.\n\nGlass Animals’ achievements were recognized with two Brit Award nominations in 2022 and a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist, marking their influence in both the alternative and mainstream music scenes. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Glass+Animals\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The band quickly established a signature style characterized by vibrant, danceable rhythms and a strong nostalgic connection to the '''80s sound''', heavily relying on bright synthesizers. Following a debut concert that quickly sold out, they released their first album, Aquellas pequeñas cosas que nunca se fueron, in 2019.\nMarsella's second full-length album, A todos los que se fueron (To All Those Who Left), marks a significant evolution in their synth-pop sound, delving into profoundly personal and mature themes of grief and homage. Released near the end of 2025, the record serves as a tribute to lost loved ones, inspired by lead singer Germán's experience with loss, moving beyond their earlier upbeat nostalgia. Produced by David Van Bylen and Juan Sueiro, the album maintains the band's electronic pop style while infusing a new layer of emotional depth, highlighted by advance singles like Para toda la eternidad and Eres esa luz. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Marsella\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Duncan Dhu was a Spanish pop-rock group of the 1980s.  The group was founded in San Sebastian, Spain in 1984 by singer Mikel Erentxun (Aristogatos), and Diego Vasallo, and Juan Ramón Viles (Los Dalton). The name Duncan Dhu comes from the book \"Kidnapped: The adventures of David Balfour\" by Robert Louis Stevenson where there is a character named Duncan Dhu, who is a lover of music. \n\nTheir style was based on an acoustic and simple pop-rock with a touch of rockabilly in great contrast with the more radical rock played in the area at the time. After being hired by 'Grabaciones Accidentales, S.A.' they contributed with two songs (Mi Amor and Bésame Mucho) to the new bands compilation La única alternativa (The Only Alternative).\n\nIn 1985 they recorded their first album, Por Tierras Escocesas (Around Scottish Lands), and Canciones (Songs) a year later, both produced by Paco Trinidad. The songs were immediately successful and gave them big popularity. After even more successful El Grito del Tiempo (The Cry of Time, 1984) and Grabaciones Olvidadas (Forgotten Recordings, a compilation of B-Sides, 1989) they became a duo and recorded the double album Autobiografía (Autobiography), with collaborations by Black and Sam Brown among others. They later also had several hits such as \"Esos Ojos Negros\" (\"Those Black Eyes\"). They finally came to a close as a band with their final cd, \"Crepúsculo y Crudités\" (Sunset and Crudités [1]) which was more orchestrated and softer than their older music.\n\nTheir most known hit is \"En Algún Lugar\" (\"In Some Place\"). The song was initially featured in Canciones, but it was the remix included in El Grito del Tiempo that became widely popular. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Duncan+Dhu\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Andres Calamaro is one of the most popular Argentinian pop-rock songwriters. A songs craftsman, as he likes to consider himself.\n\nBorn Aug 22, 1961 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, he began his professional musical career at the age of 17 playing keyboards in Raíces.\nIn 1981 he incorporated to one of the main bands of the Argentinean '80s rock scene: Los Abuelos de la Nada. Although the band was led by the brilliant Miguel Abuelo, Calamaro composed most of the band's hits, like \"Mil Horas,\" \"Así es el calor,\" \"Sin gamulán\" and \"Costumbres Argentinas.\"\n\nIn 1984 he made his solo debut with Hotel Calamaro. The album was a bizarre mix of styles and musicians, and didn't gain public or press support.\n\nIn 1985 he left Los Abuelos de la Nada and registered his second album Vida Cruel. Inspite of the important musicians and guests, such as Luis Alberto Spinetta and Charly García, the album was a disappointment: both commercially and artistically. But if as a songwriter the luck was out of reach, he had an intense and successful work as a producer of bands like Los Enanitos Verdes, Los Fabulosos Cadillacs and Don Cornelio y la zona. He also worked and collaborated with many artists of different styles and genres, a constant attitude through his whole career. The third album Por Mirarte showed Calamaro in a better shape with an established band. Released in 1988 it contains some outstanding songs such as \"Con los dientes apretados\" and \"Me olvidé de los demás,\" while others like \"Cartas sin Marcar\" and \"Loco por tí\" helped the album to get popular.\n\nWhen Calamaro released in 1989 Nadie Sale Vivo de Aquí, Argentina was living it's worst economical crisis: few albums were released. The album title suggest it all: Nobody comes out alive from here. The LP production was paralyzed, and the few that could make it were almost ignored. That was Calamaro's case. This situation lead the singer to settle in Spain, following a road taken by many Argentinean rockers. Out there in Spain he met Ariel Rot y Javier Infante, former members of Tequila. They formed Los Rodríguez in 1991, a pop-rock band that was very popular in Spain and Latin America: Calamaro's songs began to be popular like in the early '80s: the hit maker was on the road again. Curiously, from Spain, he was conquering Argentina. While being part of the band he didn't release any new solo material, just Grabaciones Encontradas 1 y 2, a couple of CDs that contained unreleased and rare material from the '80s. \n\nAfter the split of Los Rodríguez, Calamaro returned to his solo career recording Alta Suciedad in 1997, an album produced by Joe Blaney. This album brought him the commercial success that seemed to fail in his previous solo efforts, and sold 300.000 copies just in Argentina. That is certainly a huge amount for the country's small market. No doubts, that album helped him to be placed between the star legends of the national rock scene. Before that album Calamaro was considered an important character, appreciated by other musicians, but not a main one. After he broke up with his spanish girlfriend he released in 1999 the double CD Honestidad Brutal. Recorded when he was 37, it contained 37 songs of despair, love loss, drugs and regret. It was not as successful at the previous album, but showed a new Calamaro: desperate, decadent and often elegant at the same time, with a new and raw lyrical approach. El Salmon followed in spring 2001.\nCalamaro's next proyect, El Cantante, was released in 2005. A delicious mixture of tango, rock n'roll and flamenco guitars (mostly played by spanish prodigy El Niño Josele).\nAfter a break, he returned to the stages with a tour full of classics that gave birth to a live album called El Regreso on 2005, recorded with members of Bersuit Vergarabat as a backing band. This album was very well received for the charts as well as for the critics, wich lead him to different awards. One year later, on 2006, Andres published a new album from the roots of tango with the collaboration of guitarrists Niño Josele and Juanjo Dominguez. On 2007 El palacio de las flores was published, although it was recorded on 2006. The album had the collaboration and musical influence of argentine composer Lito Nebbia and was also recorded on his studio. This was the return to a classic Calamaro album with new songs and hits. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/+noredirect\/Andr%C3%A9s+Calamaro\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

He first achieved fame in the 1970s emerging from the London punk rock scene as the lead singer of the group Generation X. Subsequently, he embarked on a solo career which led to international recognition and made Idol a lead artist during the MTV-driven \"Second British Invasion\" in the US. The name \"Billy Idol\" was inspired by a schoolteacher's description of him as \"idle\".\n\nIdol began his music career in late 1976 as a guitarist in the punk rock band Chelsea. However, he soon left the group. With his former bandmate Tony James, Idol formed Generation X. With Idol as lead singer, the band achieved success in the United Kingdom and released three studio albums on Chrysalis Records, then disbanded. In 1981, Idol moved to New York City to pursue his solo career in collaboration with guitarist Steve Stevens. His debut studio album, Billy Idol (1982), was a commercial success.

        "biografia":"Miley Ray Cyrus (born Destiny Hope Cyrus; November 23, 1992) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. Regarded as a pop icon, Cyrus has been recognized for her evolving artistry and image reinventions. She is a daughter of singer Billy Ray Cyrus, and deemed one of the few examples of a child star with a successful entertainment career as an adult. Cyrus emerged as a teen idol as the title character in the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana (2006–2011), which evolved into a commercially successful franchise. As Hannah Montana, she achieved success on the Billboard charts with two number-one soundtracks.\n\nCyrus's solo career started with the US number-one pop rock albums Meet Miley Cyrus (2007) and Breakout (2008). Her EP The Time of Our Lives (2009) reached number two in the US. Its lead single \"Party in the U.S.A.\" became one of the best-selling singles of all time, later becoming certified 14-times platinum in the US. Trying to establish a mature image, she explored dance-pop in Can't Be Tamed (2010), which received mixed reviews. Cyrus later signed to RCA Records and took a new artistic direction with the hip hop and R&B-influenced Bangerz (2013). Her fifth chart-topping album, it yielded the hit single \"We Can't Stop\" and her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one \"Wrecking Ball\". She then dabbled in experimental music on Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (2015), embraced country pop on Younger Now (2017), and delved into rock genres on Plastic Hearts (2020). Shifting to Columbia Records in 2021, Cyrus released her eighth studio album Endless Summer Vacation (2023). Its lead single \"Flowers\" became internationally successful, marking her second US number-one song, and winning two Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year.\n\nAs an actress, Cyrus starred in the films Bolt (2008), Hannah Montana: The Movie (2009), The Last Song (2010), LOL (2012), and So Undercover (2013). On television, she was the subject of the documentary Miley: The Movement (2013), led the miniseries Crisis in Six Scenes (2017), served as a coach on two seasons of The Voice (2016–2017), and starred in the \"Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too\" episode of Black Mirror (2019). She also hosted the holiday special Miley's New Year's Eve Party (2021–2022).\n\nCyrus has received various accolades, including three Grammy Awards, one Brit Award, five Billboard Music Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards, eight Guinness World Records. She was named Disney Legend, in recognition for her contributions to The Walt Disney Company. Cyrus was ranked as one of the greatest artists of all time, the ninth-greatest Billboard 200 female artist, and among the greatest pop stars of the 21st century by Billboard and is the eighth-highest-certified female digital singles artist by the RIAA. She has featured in listicles such as the Time 100 (2008 and 2014), Forbes Celebrity 100 (2010 and 2015), and 30 Under 30 (2014 and 2021).

        "biografia":"Sir Elton Hercules John (born Reginald Kenneth Dwight; 25 March 1947) is a British singer, pianist, and composer. Collaborating with lyricist Bernie Taupin since 1967, John is one of the most successful artists of all time, having sold over 300 million records worldwide in a seven-decade career in music. He is acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his work during the 1970s, and his lasting impact on the music industry. John's music and showmanship have had a significant impact on popular music. His songwriting partnership with Taupin is one of the most successful in history.\n\nJohn was raised in the Pinner suburb of London and learned to play piano at an early age, forming the blues band Bluesology in 1962. After leaving Bluesology in 1967 to embark on a solo career, John met Taupin after they both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years, they wrote songs for other artists, and John worked as a session musician for artists. John released his debut album Empty Sky in 1969, and a year later formed the Elton John Band and released his first hit single, \"Your Song\".\n\nJohn's critical success was at its peak in the 1970s when he released a streak of chart-topping albums in the US and UK, which began with Honky Château (1972) and culminated with Rock of the Westies (1975). John continued his success in the 1980s and 1990s, having several hit singles and albums in both decades, and has continued to record new music since then. He has also had success in musical films and theatre, composing music for The Lion King, Aida, and Billy Elliot the Musical. In 2018, John began his ongoing farewell tour Farewell Yellow Brick Road, which is scheduled to conclude in 2023. The 2019 biopic Rocketman dramatized his life and career.\n\nOutside of music, John is an HIV\/AIDS charity fundraiser and has been involved in the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s. He established the Elton John AIDS Foundation in 1992, which has raised over £300 million since its inception, and a year later he began hosting his annual Foundation Academy Awards Party, which has since become one of the biggest high-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry. John was the chairman and director of Watford F.C, from 1976 to 1987, and again from 1997 to 2002, and is an honorary life president of the club. From the late 1970s to the late 1980s, John developed a severe addiction problem to drugs and alcohol but has been sober since 1990. He entered into a civil partnership with Canadian filmmaker David Furnish in 2005; they married after same-sex marriage became legal in England and Wales in 2014.\n\nJohn has sold over 300 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time. He has more than fifty Top 40 hits on the UK Singles Chart and US Billboard Hot 100, including nine number-ones in the UK and US, as well as seven consecutive number-one albums in the US. His tribute single \"Candle in the Wind 1997\", a rewritten version of his 1974 single in dedication to Princess Diana, sold over 33 million copies worldwide and is the best-selling chart single of all time. In 2021, John became the first solo artist with UK Top 10 singles across six decades.\n\nJohn has received numerous awards, including five Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards; including for Outstanding Contribution to Music; two Academy Awards, two Golden Globes, a Tony Award, a Laurence Olivier Award, a Disney Legend Award, and the Kennedy Center Honor. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and is a fellow of The Ivors Academy. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for services to music and charitable services in 1998 and was appointed a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour by King Charles III (then Prince of Wales) in 2020.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Elton_John\n\nSolo studio albums\nEmpty Sky (1969)\nElton John (1970)\nTumbleweed Connection (1970)\nMadman Across the Water (1971)\nHonky Château (1972)\nDon't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player (1973)\nGoodbye Yellow Brick Road (1973)\nCaribou (1974)\nCaptain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy (1975)\nRock of the Westies (1975)\nBlue Moves (1976)\nA Single Man (1978)\nVictim of Love (1979)\n21 at 33 (1980)\nThe Fox (1981)\nJump Up!

        "biografia":"Yo-Yo Ma (born October 7, 1955) is an American cellist. Born to and partially raised by Chinese parents in Paris and educated in New York City, he was a child prodigy, performing from the age of four and a half. He graduated from the Juilliard School and Harvard University, attended Columbia University, and has performed as a soloist with orchestras around the world. He has recorded more than 92 albums and received 19 Grammy Awards.\n\nIn addition to recordings of the standard classical repertoire, Ma has recorded a wide variety of folk music, such as American bluegrass music, traditional Chinese melodies, the tangos of Argentine composer Astor Piazzolla, and Brazilian music. He has also collaborated with artists from a diverse range of genres, including Bobby McFerrin, Carlos Santana, Chris Botti, Diana Krall, James Taylor, Miley Cyrus, and Sting.\n\nMa has been a United Nations Messenger of Peace since 2006. He has received numerous awards, including the Avery Fisher Prize in 1978, The Glenn Gould Prize in 1999, the National Medal of Arts in 2001, the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011, Kennedy Center Honors in 2011, the Polar Music Prize in 2012, and the Birgit Nilsson Prize in 2022. He was named as one of Time's 100 Most Influential People of 2020. Aside from English, Ma is fluent in Mandarin Chinese and French.\n\nMa's primary performance instrument is the Davidov cello, made in 1712 by Antonio Stradivari\n\nMa's mother, Marina Lu, was a singer, and his father, Hiao-Tsiun Ma, was a violinist, composer and professor of music at Nanjing National Central University (now relocated in Taoyuan, Taiwan; predecessor of the present-day Nanjing University and Southeast University). They both migrated from the Republic of China to France during the Chinese Civil War. Ma's sister, Yeou-Cheng Ma, played the violin and piano professionally before obtaining a medical degree from Harvard and becoming a pediatrician. The family moved to New York City when Ma was seven.\n\nFrom the age of three, Ma played the drums, violin, piano, and later viola, but settled on the cello in 1960 at age four. When three-year-old Yo-Yo said he wanted a big instrument, his father went to see Etienne Vatelot, a foremost violin maker in Paris who, after a chat, lent him a 1\/16th cello. He jokes that his first choice was the double bass due to its large size, but he compromised and took up the cello instead. When his father realized that Yo-Yo was ready for a better teacher, a well-known cello instructor, Mme Michelle Lepinte, was selected. He began performing before audiences at age five and played for presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy when he was seven. At age eight, he appeared on American television with his sister in an event introduced by Leonard Bernstein. In 1964, Isaac Stern introduced them on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and they performed the Sonata of Sammartini. He attended Trinity School in New York but transferred to the Professional Children's School, where he graduated at age 15. He appeared as a soloist with the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra in a performance of Tchaikovsky's Rococo Variations.\n\nMa studied at the Juilliard School at age 19 with Leonard Rose and attended Columbia University, but dropped out. He later enrolled at Harvard College. Prior to entering Harvard, Ma played in the Marlboro Festival Orchestra under the direction of cellist, conductor and Ma’s childhood hero Pablo Casals. He spent four summers at the Marlboro Music Festival after meeting and falling in love with Mount Holyoke College sophomore and festival administrator Jill Hornor during his first summer there in 1972.\n\nEven before that time, Ma gained fame and performed with many of the world's major orchestras. He has also played chamber music, often with pianist Emanuel Ax, with whom he has a close friendship from their days at Juilliard. Ma received his bachelor's degree in anthropology from Harvard in 1976,  and in 1991 received an honorary doctorate from Harvard.\n\nYo-Yo Ma has been referred to by critics as \"omnivorous\" and possesses an eclectic repertoire. In addition to numerous recordings of the standard classical repertoire, he has recorded Baroque pieces using period instruments; American bluegrass music; traditional Chinese melodies, including the soundtrack to the film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; the tangos of Argentinian composer Astor Piazzolla; Brazilian music, recording traditional and contemporary songs composed by Antônio Carlos Jobim and Pixinguinha; a collaboration with Bobby McFerrin (where Ma admitted to being terrified by McFerrin's improvisation); and the music of modern minimalist Philip Glass, in such works as the 2002 Naqoyqatsi.\n\nMa is known for his smooth, rich tone, soulful lyricism, and virtuosity. He released a cello recording of Niccolò Paganini's Caprice No. 24 for solo violin and Zoltán Kodály's Solo Sonata. \n\nOn May 1, 2019, he performed at Paranal Observatory in the Atacama desert. He said that his interest in astronomy motivated him to visit and perform there. \n\nMa's albums include recordings of cello concertos, sonatas for cello and piano, works for solo cello, and a variety of chamber music. He has also recorded in non-classical styles, notably in collaboration with artists such as Bobby McFerrin, Carlos Santana, Chris Botti, Chris Thile, Diana Krall, James Taylor, Miley Cyrus and Sting. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Yo-Yo+Ma\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Roberto Agustín Miguel Santiago Samuel Trujillo Veracruz (born October 23, 1964) is an American musician and songwriter who is the bassist for American heavy metal band Metallica. He first rose to prominence as the bassist of crossover thrash band Suicidal Tendencies from 1989 to 1995, while also collaborating with Suicidal Tendencies frontman Mike Muir for funk metal supergroup Infectious Grooves. After leaving Suicidal Tendencies, he played with Cyco Miko, Jerry Cantrell, Black Label Society and Ozzy Osbourne before joining Metallica in 2003, and is the band's longest-serving bassist. He was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Metallica in 2009.\n\nHe grew up in Venice, California and was a standout among other local musicians. He played in a few local bands before joining Suicidal Tendencies in 1989, replacing the band's second bassist Bob Heathcote. His work with Suicidal Tendencies is considered to be outstanding, and he is responsible for adding in funk influences to the band seen prominently on albums Lights...Camera...Revolution! and especially on Art Of Rebellion. He eventually turned bandmate Mike Muir on to funk music, and the two formed Infectious Grooves to play more funk oriented music.\n\nAlthough at times Trujillo has been known to use a pick, he prefers to use his fingers, like the late Metallica bassist Cliff Burton, but unlike Trujillo's predecessor Jason Newsted (who used a pick almost exclusively).\n\nRobert Trujillo became Metallica's current bassist on February 24, 2003 after auditioning for the band and fitting right in with fellow band members James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, and Kirk Hammett. The members of Metallica offered him $1 million up front, on top of the percentage he would earn by being in the band. The audition and hiring appear in the film Some Kind of Monster.\n\nRobert collaborated with Benji Webbe of Skindred & Dub War on a project called Mass Mental and released an album in Japan entitled \"How to write Love Songs\".

        "biografia":"Suzi Quatro (born Susan Kay Quattrocchi, June 3, 1950, Detroit, Michigan) is an American singer-songwriter, musician, radio personality, and actress. Suzi grew up in the States, experiencing the rock and roll revolution as it happened. She became an icon of the 70s glam rock era with her 'bad girl' image that went on to influence other female acts that arose in her wake, including The Runaways and L7. Known as \"The Wild One\" for her song of the same name, Suzi has prominently played the American originals of songs only meekly covered by British artists and many original rock classics, songs not allowed to escape onto the British airwaves of her airwaves due to the BBC's control.\n\nA talented singer and bass guitarist, trained in classical piano and percussion, she joined her sisters in the 60s Detroit garage rock group The Pleasure Seekers whilst still in her teens and never looked back. By the early 70s, Suzi went off to England to work with producer Mickie Most, while her sister Patti joined the all-woman rock band Fanny. An underground following spread around Suzi's charisma and powerful singing.\n\nSuzi found herself singing the material of songwriting duo Chinn & Chapman, musicians who were also having hits with Sweet. Combining shades of bubblegum pop with a hard rock spirit, similar to the power pop ethos of the era, Suzi embraced the glam sound. Under their tutelage, she had four top ten rock hits in the U.K., but she remained mostly unknown in the U.S. \n\nHowever, her U.K. fame expanded through the 70s, with Suzi becoming a successful solo singer, bassist, and songwriter with a string of charting hits. Her appeal extended into the 80s while many of her contempoaries broke up. Notable songs of his period include \"Can The Can\", \"Devil Gate Drive\", \"Tear Me Apart\", and \"The Wild One\", among many others.\n\nSuzi extended her career to television in 1979 when she guest starred for three seasons on the hit television series 'Happy Days'. She played the character Leather Tuscadero, who was the younger sister of Fonzie's love interest, Pinky Tuscadero. In 1979, at the height of the disco era, she finally made the U.S. Top Five with the track \"Stumblin' In\", a duet with Chris Norman.\n\nIn her musical career she has had 16 hit singles, sold over 45 million records and toured since 1964. She has also had guest appearances in the Runaways documentary \"Edgeplay\" and various UK television shows including Minder, Dempsey And Makepeace and Absolutely Fabulous. \n\nIn 1990, Suzi trod the boards in London's West End playing the lead in the musical Annie Get Your Gun and wrote and starred in a musical about Talullah Bankhead. \n\nSuzi continues to write, perform and record her own original material and has a forthcoming new album Naked Under Leather. She also hosts an excellent show on BBC Radio 2.\n\n\nQuatro's first single \"Rolling Stone\" did not achieve popularity anywhere except Portugal, where it made number one. Most introduced Quatro to the songwriting and production team Nicky Chinn\/Mike Chapman. Her second single \"Can the Can\" (1973) was a number one hit throughout Europe and in Australia. It was followed up by three further hits: \"48 Crash\" (1973), \"Daytona Demon\" (1973) and \"Devil Gate Drive\" (1974) on RAK Records. Her first two albums were also European and Australian successes.\n\nThese recordings, however, met little success in her native U.S., despite tours in the mid-1970s supporting Alice Cooper, and, except in Australia, the popularity of Quatro's rocking glam rock declined from 1975. In the interim, she did enjoy success as a session player.\n\nQuatro's fortunes did not change until 1978 when \"If You Can't Give Me Love\" became a hit in the UK and Australia. This did nothing to prompt Stateside success, but \"Stumblin' In\", a duet recorded that same year for RSO Records with Chris Norman of Smokie secured a #4 peak in the U.S. Both tracks featured on the \"If You Knew Suzi\" album. A year later, Quatro released \"Suzi... And Other Four Letter Words\". She called it her favourite album. This featured singles, such as \"She's In Love With You\", which made number 11 in the UK , \"Mama's Boy\" (34) and \"I've Never Been In Love\" (56). In 1980, her song \"Rock Hard\" was featured on the soundtrack of the cult film Times Square, along with some punk and new wave bands like Talking Heads, Ramones, XTC and The Pretenders. This success period proved brief however, and her last UK hit was \"Heart of Stone\" in late 1982. In 1985 Quatro collaborated with Bronski Beat and members of The Kinks, Eddie and the Hot Rods, and Dr Feelgood on the Mark Cunningham-produced version of David Bowie's classic \"Heroes\", released the following year as the 1986 BBC \"Children In Need\" single.\n\nIn December 2005, a documentary chronicling Quatro's life, \"Naked under leather\" directed by former Runaway Victory Tischler Blue appeared. In February 2006, Quatro released \"Back To the Drive\", produced by Sweet guitarist Andy Scott. The album's title track was penned by her former collaborator Mike Chapman.\n\nMarch 2007 saw Quatro release a version of The Eagles' \"Desperado\", followed by the publication of her autobiography, \"Unzipped\".\n\nSuzi Quatro has sold over 45 million records.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.suziquatro.com <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Suzi+Quatro\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

His music is known for its intimate nature, drawing inspiration from \"romantic encounters and dimly lit rooms.\"\n\nJaffe's musical journey began while attending boarding school in Millbrook, New York. It was during this time that he adopted the name Del Water Gap, inspired by the sight of it handwritten on the back of a box truck. Initially, Jaffe played drums in a noise rock band, where he had limited opportunities to showcase his vocals. Seeking further education in music and sound production, he pursued studies at the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at NYU.\n\nWhile Del Water Gap was originally a band, it eventually transitioned into Jaffe's solo project. The lineup underwent changes during his college years, including a collaboration with singer-songwriter Maggie Rogers, who was involved for a six-month period. Jaffe and Rogers initially connected during their freshman year of college, and they released the song \"New Song,\" recorded in 2014. Collaborations have played a significant role in Jaffe's career, as he also worked with Claud on the single \"My Body\" and co-wrote and produced Claud's \"Never Meant To Call.\"\n\nIn 2018, Jaffe signed with Terrible Records and released the single \"Laid Down My Arms.\" This was followed by the release of the singles \"Chastain\" and \"Theory of Emotion\" as a lead-up to his third EP, \"Don't Get Dark,\" also under Terrible Records.\n\nDel Water Gap signed with Atlantic Records in 2020, and subsequently released the tracks \"Ode to a Conversation Stuck in Your Throat\" and \"Mariposa.\" The song \"Ode to a Conversation Stuck in Your Throat\" gained significant attention when actresses Margaret Qualley and Kaitlyn Dever shared an Instagram video of themselves participating in a \"socially distant dance party\" to the song during the initial summer of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn 2021, Del Water Gap joined Mom + Pop Music, releasing the single \"Hurting Kind\" along with a music video co-directed by Charlie Plummer. The video received support from MTV, and images from the shoot were featured in GQ. Del Water Gap's debut album was released with Mom + Pop Music in October 2021, followed by a headline tour and a support tour alongside Jeremy Zucker. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Del+Water+Gap\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

He was raised in Cordoba where he studied guitar playing, most famously under Manolo Sanlúcar, a renowned flamenco guitarist with whom he worked for ten years. Amigo gained high regard in the flamenco scene at a relatively young age. He is considered by many the crown prince of the great flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucía, who is considered the father of modern flamenco guitar playing.\n\nAmigo has developed a unique style of playing, distinct for his alented and large use of picado, a rapid alteration between the index and middle fingers. He tends to mix traditional flamenco playing, as well as flamenco cante (singing), palmas (clapping), and jaleos (shouting), with modern sounds (many of which are distinctly Amigo's creations) and elements of fusion. This leaves feelings about him in the flamenco world divided, with purists decrying his straying from \"true flamenco\", and a more forward-looking audience enjoying his innovations.\n\nDiscography:\n\n1991 - De Mi Corazón Al Aire \n1995 - Vivencias Imaginadas \n1997 - Poeta \n2000 - Ciudad de Las Ideas \n2003 - Canto \n2005 - Un momento en el sonido \n2009 - Paseo De Gracia \n2013 - Tierra \n\n Official Website <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Vicente+Amigo\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Gary Moore (born April 4, 1952 as Robert William Gary Moore in Belfast, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom; died February 6, 2011 in Malaga, Spain) is acknowledged as one of the finest guitarists to have originated in Ireland. He was a virtuoso guitarist and is considered by his fans to be one of the best guitar players ever.\n\nIn a career dating back to the 1960s he has played with bands including Thin Lizzy, Colosseum II, Greg Lake and Skid Row as well as having a successful solo career.\n\nMoore started performing from a young age and got his first good guitar at the age of 14. In a career lasting over 30 years he has demonstrated that he is a fine musician, and his unique style of playing has adapted to very different music genres, including jazz rock jazz, blues, electric blues, hard rock, celtic rock and heavy metal.\n\nOne of his most famous non-blues records is Wild Frontier, his first studio album after a trip back to his native Belfast, Northern Ireland in 1985, this album has several songs about Ireland and even the music itself is steeped in Celtic roots. The title track was intended to be sung by Phil Lynott, however Lynott's death in January 1986 prevented that. The album is dedicated to Lynott's memory, with the words \"For Philip\" on the rear cover.\n\nWild Frontier contains the hit \"Over the Hills and Far Away\", which reached #20 in the UK as well as a cover of the Australian band The Easybeats' hit of the middle of the 1960s, \"Friday on My Mind\". The Max Middleton-penned \"The Loner\" was originally recorded by Cozy Powell for his Over the Top album in 1979 (which Moore did perform on, albeit not on Powell's recording of \"The Loner\"), but was substantially altered by Moore for his own recording, thus he was credited as a co-writer.\n\nFor blues fans, Moore's best recorded, live performance on video is \"LIVE BLUES\" recorded in a small night club in London and was released in 1992 on VHS. It is now available on DVD as well. \"LIVE BLUES\" also features two songs with B.B. King appearing on stage with Moore. \"The Thrill Is Gone\" on this recording is probably the best version of this, complete with More's Midnight Horns, female backup singers and dueling guitars. Many of Moore's standard songs are on this 90 minute show and were mixed better than most of the studio versions of the same tunes for a very rich and full sound. Even Moore's voice sounds better than it usually does in the studio. Moore did not seem interested in touring the United States.\n\nConnection with Peter Green\n\nAccording to numerous interviews he has given to guitar magazines, he was the protege of British Blues pioneer Peter Green, whom he had always admired ever since the Bluesbreakers days. When Green quit Fleetwood Mac and the entire music scene, he sold his famous nasal-sounding 1959 Gibson Les Paul to Moore for the same price that Moore had managed to sell his then guitar (a Gibson SG) for. The nasal sound of the neck pickup on Green's guitar was not, as used to be believed, the result of the pickup having been turned backwards, but instead its two coils had been - perhaps accidentally - reconnected in parallel and out of phase, as per the \"in between\" positions of a Fender Stratocaster. Moore has used this guitar in the recordings of some songs of his albums Still Got The Blues, After Hours and Blues For Greeny. Green and Moore also reportedly had a disagreement regarding what guitar the former was playing in the song \"Albatross\". Moore insists it was the Les Paul, because the guitar tone was particularly warm and rich in the bass, while Peter Green maintains he was using a Strat, as the vibrato in that song was not finger vibrato, but subtle tremolo arm vibrato. Up to the day of his death, Green and Moore remained good friends.\n\nGuitars used\n\nOver the years Gary has used numerous guitars. These include: Peter Green's 1959 Gibson Les Paul, Peter Green's 1961 Fender Stratocaster and 1950s Gibson Les Paul Junior. He has also used guitars from Charvel, Ibanez, Hamer, Jackson and Heritage. Amplification has generally come from Marshall, though Soldanos and Fender have also been used, as well as transistor-driven Dean Markley units (especially in the studio). He also has used numerous effects over the years. these include; Delay units such as the Echoplex, Overdrive\/Booster units such as the Boss DS-1, Ibanez Tubescreamer variants, Marshall Bluesbreaker and Guv'nor pedals as well as Wah-Wah pedals such as the Vox Wah. He appears nowadays to favour Gibson and Fender Guitars through Marshall amps with any of the above Overdrive pedals and Wah pedals to make his sound.\n\nSolo career\n\nIn 1973 he released his first solo album as the Gary Moore Band. In 1979 his solo career started again with help from Phil Lynott, the combination of Gary's blues based guitar and Phil's voice produced \"Parisenne Walkways\" which reached the UK Top Ten in April 1979 and the no.2 album 'Black Rose'. After a series of powerful rock records Gary returned to blues music with Still Got the Blues, with contributions from B. B. King, Albert King and Albert Collins the album was well received by fans and a huge success. Gary stayed with the blues format until 1997 when he decided to experiment with modern dance beats in Dark Days In Paradise; this left many fans as well as the music press confused. Back to the Blues saw Gary return to the tried and tested blues format.\n\n\nAlbums\n\n    * Grinding Stone, 1973\n    * Parisienne Walkways, 1977\n    * Back on the Streets, 1978\n    * Corridors of Power, 1982\n    * Live at the Marquee, 1983\n    * Rockin' Every Night - Live in Japan, 1983\n    * Victims of the Future, 1983\n    * Dirty Fingers, 1984\n    * We Want Moore, 1984\n    * Run for Cover, 1985\n    * Wild Frontier, 1987\n    * After the War, 1989\n    * Still Got the Blues, 1990\n    * After Hours, 1992\n    * Blues Alive, 1993\n    * Ballads & Blues 1982-1994, 1994\n    * Blues For Greeny, 1995\n    * Dark Days in Paradise, 1997\n    * Out in the Fields - The Very Best of Part 1, 1998\n    * Blood of Emeralds - The Very Best of Part 2, 1999\n    * A Different Beat, 1999\n    * Back to the Blues, 2001\n    * Power Of The Blues, 2004\n    * Old New Ballads Blues, 2006\n    * Close As You Get, 2007\n    * Bad For You Baby, 2008\n     \n\nSingles\n\n    * Parisienne Walkways\n    * Out in the Fields\n    * Empty Rooms\n    * Wild Frontier\n    * Still Got the Blues\n\n\nThe Future (2005-present)\n\nLater on in 2006, Gary will support BB King on his 'Farewell UK Tour'. It unfortunately did not lead to a tour of the United States with BB King.\n\nThe studio album entitled 'Old New Ballads Blues' was a follow up of 2004's 'Power of the Blues' and it featured new material as well as new versions of fan favourites 'Midnight Blues' and 'All your Love'\n\nGary Moore has also sold his Les Paul that was given to him by Peter Green to a private owner. \n\nOn February 6th 2011, he died from a heart attack in his sleep while on holiday in Spain.\n\nExternal links\n\n    * The Official Gary Moore World Wide Website: http:\/\/www.gary-moore.com\/\n\n    * The Lord Of The Strings - World Wide Gary Moore Fansite: http:\/\/www.garymoore.hu\/eng.htm Thanks for the music. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Gary+Moore\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

He is known primarily as the founding member and leader of the heavy metal band Motörhead. His unmistakable appearance, with his facial totem moles, sideburn to moustache connection (now known universally as \"The Lemmy\"), and gravelly voice have made him a cult figure known well beyond the world of rock music.\n\nLemmy was born in Burslem, Staffordshire and raised in Anglesey, Wales. His father, a clergyman, left the family when Lemmy was three months old; the experience helped to imbue a deep hatred of religion in Lemmy and this is reflected in a number of his songs.\n\nRecording and performing career\n\n1960-1970: Early years\nIn Stockport, he joined local bands The Rainmakers then The Motown Sect, who enjoyed three years playing northern clubs. Wanting to progress further, in 1965 he joined The Rockin' Vickers[8] who signed a deal with CBS and released three singles and toured Europe, reportedly being the first British band to visit Yugoslavia. With the band living in a Manchester flat, he had a relationship with a girl named Tracy who bore him a son, Paul, although it would not be until the boy was 6 that Lemmy had any involvement with the child.[4]\nWanting to progress even further, Lemmy relocated to London in 1967. Sharing a flat with Noel Redding, he got a job as a roadie for The Jimi Hendrix Experience. In 1968 he joined Sam Gopal and recorded the album Escalator and the single \"Horse\". After meeting Simon King in a Chelsea shopping centre during 1969, he joined the band Opal Butterfly, but the band soon folded, having previously failed to raise enough interest with their preceding CBS singles.[4]\nAt this point Lemmy thought about changing his legal name to his stepfather's surname of Willis, but with his actual father's surname of Kilmister, he decided changing his birth certificate and passport would be too much hassle, so did not bother. An attempted reconciliation in 1970 between Lemmy and his birth father broke down, with Lemmy describing him as a \"nasty little weasel\".[9]\n1971-1975: Hawkwind\nSee also Hawkwind (1970-75: United Artists era)\nIn 1971, Lemmy joined the space rock band, Hawkwind, who were based in Ladbroke Grove, London. He had no experience as a bass guitarist, but quickly developed a distinctive style that was strongly shaped by his early experience as a rhythm guitarist, often using double stops and chords rather than the single notes preferred by most bassists. His bass work was a fundamental part of the Hawkwind sound during his tenure, perhaps best documented on Space Ritual. He also provided lead vocals on a number of songs, including the band's biggest UK chart single, \"Silver Machine\", which reached No.3 in 1972.\n1975-present: Motörhead\nMain article: Motörhead\nIn 1975 Lemmy was fired from Hawkwind after he was arrested at Canadian customs on drug possession charges; he spent five days in jail.[3][10] He went on to form a new band with guitarist Larry Wallis (former member of the Pink Fairies, Steve Took's Shagrat and UFO) and drummer Lucas Fox. Lemmy's connection with Took (formerly of T. Rex) was not limited to Wallis, as they were personal friends and Took was the stepfather to Lemmy's son, Paul. This new band was originally called Bastard. When his manager informed him that a band by that name will never get a slot on \"Top of the Pops\", Lemmy changed the band's name to Motörhead – the title of the last song Lemmy wrote for Hawkwind.[11]\nSoon after, both Wallis and Fox were replaced with guitarist \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke and drummer Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor, and with this line-up the band began to achieve success. The band's sound appealed to both Lemmy's original fans and, eventually, to fans of the punk rock scene. In fact, he asserts that he generally feels more kinship with punks than with heavy metal; he even played with The Damned for a handful of gigs when they had no regular bassist[12]—and Lemmy's guttural vocals were unique in the world of rock at that time. The band's success peaked between 1980 and 1981 with a number of UK chart hits, including the classic single \"Ace of Spades\" (still a crowd favourite today) and the #1 live album No Sleep 'til Hammersmith. Motörhead have since gone on to become one of the most influential bands in the heavy metal music genre, and although Lemmy is the only constant member, are still performing and releasing records to this day. Despite Motörhead's many member changes over their 35-year history, the current lineup of Lemmy, Phil Campbell and Mikkey Dee has remained constant since 1995.\nLemmy has also worked with a number of other musicians over his career, and occasionally guests with Hawkwind. He wrote the song \"R.A.M.O.N.E.S\" for the Ramones, which he still plays in his live sets as a tribute to the band. He was brought in as a songwriter for Ozzy Osbourne's 1991 No More Tears album, providing lyrics for the tracks \"Hellraiser\", (which Motörhead would later record themselves and release a single), \"Desire\", \"I Don't Want to Change the World\", and the single \"Mama I'm Coming Home\". Lemmy has noted in several magazine and television interviews that he made more money from the royalties of that one song than he had in his entire time with Motörhead. After being diagnosed with Type-2 diabetes in 2000, which led to a brief hospitalization, Lemmy again appeared with Motörhead at WrestleMania 17. Lemmy published his autobiography, White Line Fever in November 2002. In 2005, Motörhead won their first Grammy in the Best Metal Performance category with their cover of Metallica's \"Whiplash\". He lives in a two room flat in Los Angeles, two blocks away from his favourite hangout the Rainbow Bar and Grill.[13]\nAn officially licensed Lemmy figurine has been produced. Available as a \"regular\" or \"special\" edition, Lemmy recalls:\nI had to stand on this platform while the camera went around and did the hologram thing and then they made the model, only smaller. They said it's an action figure, and I said, 'So, you're gonna put a dick on it?' They said, 'No.' I said, 'Well, then it's not going to get much action then, is it?' A bad name for it, right?[14]\nLemmy appeared as an unlockable character in the game Guitar Hero: Metallica.[15] He also stars as a character in Brütal Legend named Kill Master, whom he voices.\nIn October 2009 it was announced that he had been involved in recording a cover of \"Stand by Me\" featuring Lemmy on Vocals and Bass, Dave Lombardo of Slayer on Drums and produced by DJ and Producer, Baron. The song was made for legendary Pro Skateboarder Geoff Rowley.\nLemmy appeared on the song \"Doctor Alibi\" from Slash's self-titled solo album.[16] The digital downloads of \"Doctor Alibi\" include the comment \"Featuring Lemmy Kilmeister\". This comment spells his surname with an 'e' not previously included in the \"Kilmister\" spelling. It is not known if this was a simple error or an intentional spelling change by the artist. This is untrue, as that is the German spelling of his name that he does infact use, usually when in Germany.[original research?]\n\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lemmy\n\n2.

        "biografia":"Motörhead was an English rock band formed in London in 1975 by bassist and lead vocalist Lemmy Kilmister, guitarist Larry Wallis, and drummer Lucas Fox. Kilmister was the primary songwriter and the only constant member. The band is often considered a precursor to the new wave of British heavy metal, which re-energized heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Several guitarists and drummers played in Motörhead, but most of their best-selling albums and singles featured drummer Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor and guitarist \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke. From 1992 until the band's break-up in 2015, the group consisted of Kilmister, guitarist Phil Campbell, and drummer Mikkey Dee.\n\nMotörhead released 24 studio albums, 21 live recordings, 16 compilation albums, and five EPs over a career spanning 40 years. Usually performing as a power trio, they achieved particular success in the early 1980s with several singles reaching the UK Top 40 chart. The albums \"Overkill\" and \"Bomber\" (both 1979), \"Ace of Spades\" (1980), and the live album \"No Sleep 'til Hammersmith\" (1981) helped establish Motörhead's reputation as a leading rock band. The band was ranked number 26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock, and in 2016, Loudwire named them the eighth-best metal band of all time. As of 2025, Motörhead have sold more than 25 million albums worldwide.\n\nWhile most often classified as heavy metal, Motörhead has been credited with influencing several musical scenes, particularly thrash metal and speed metal. Kilmister, however, described the band as a rock and roll group, noting that they had more in common with punk bands but with a unique sound. Motörhead is recognized within both punk and metal communities. Their lyrics often addressed themes such as war, morality, abuse of power, promiscuity, substance use, and gambling, the latter being the focus of their hit song \"Ace of Spades\".\n\nLemmy died on 28 December 2015 from cardiac arrhythmia and congestive heart failure, following a diagnosis of prostate cancer. The day after his death, members Dee and Campbell confirmed that Motörhead had disbanded. By 2018, all three members of the band's most recognized line-up—Lemmy, Taylor, and Clarke—had passed away.\n\nDiscography\nMotörhead (1977)\nOverkill (1979)\nBomber (1979)\nOn Parole (1979)\nAce of Spades (1980)\nIron Fist (1982)\nAnother Perfect Day (1983)\nOrgasmatron (1986)\nRock 'n' Roll (1987)\n1916 (1991)\nMarch ör Die (1992)\nBastards (1993)\nSacrifice (1995)\nOvernight Sensation (1996)\nSnake Bite Love (1998)\nWe Are Motörhead (2000)\nHammered (2002)\nInferno (2004)\nKiss of Death (2006)\nMotörizer (2008)\nThe Wörld Is Yours (2010)\nAftershock (2013)\nBad Magic (2015)\nThe Manticore Tapes (2025) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/+noredirect\/Mot%C3%B6rhead\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"A Day to Remember is a post-hardcore band from Ocala, Florida, founded in 2003 by guitarist Tom Denney and drummer Bobby Scruggs. They are mainly known for their unusual amalgamation of metalcore and pop punk as a musical style, as well as playing other styles. The band consists of vocalist Jeremy McKinnon, rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Neil Westfall, bassist Joshua Woodard, percussion and drummer Alex Shelnutt and lead guitarist Kevin Skaff.\n\nSigning with Indianola for their first album, And Their Name Was Treason (2005), Scruggs was replaced by Shelnutt in 2006. Later that year the band recorded For Those Who Have Heart (2007) for Victory. They embarked on several tours of the UK and U.S. and played at several festivals, before recording and releasing Homesick (2009). While promoting Homesick on tour, Denney was replaced by Skaff. Soon after releasing their next album, What Separates Me from You (2010), the band went on a worldwide tour to promote it.

        "biografia":"Lynyrd Skynyrd (pronounced \/ˌlɛnərd ˈskɪnərd\/ LEN-ərd-SKIN-ərd) is a Southern Rock band, formed in Jacksonville, Florida, USA in 1964. The band became prominent in the Southern United States in 1973, and rose to worldwide recognition before three members and one road crew member died in an airplane crash in 1977. The band reformed in 1987 for a reunion tour with lead singer Ronnie Van Zant's younger brother Johnny as the frontman. Lynyrd Skynyrd continues to tour and record. Of its original members, only Gary Rossington remains with the band as of 2010. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 13, 2006.\n\nHistory\nEarly years\n\nIn the summer of 1964, teenage friends Ronnie Van Zant, Allen Collins, and Gary Rossington, formed the band \"The Noble Five\", which then changed in 1965 to \"My Backyard\", when Larry Junstrom and Bob Burns joined in Jacksonville, Florida. Their early influences included British Invasion bands such as Free, The Yardbirds, The Rolling Stones, and The Beatles, as well as Southern blues and country & western music. In 1968, the group won a local Battle of the Bands contest and the opening slot on several Southeast shows for the California-based psychedelic rock band Strawberry Alarm Clock.\n\nIn 1970, Van Zant sought a new name. \"One Percent\" and \"The Noble Five\" were each considered before the group settled on Leonard Skinnerd, a mocking tribute to a physical-education teacher at Robert E. Lee High School, Leonard Skinner, who was notorious for strictly enforcing the school's policy against boys having long hair. The more distinctive spelling was adopted before they released their first album. Despite their high school acrimony, the band developed a friendlier relationship with Skinner in later years, and invited him to introduce them at a concert in the Jacksonville Memorial Coliseum.\n\nIn 1970, the band auditioned for Alan Walden, who would later become their manager on the newly formed Hustler's Inc. Walden worked with the band until 1974, when management was turned over to Pete Rudge. The band continued to perform throughout the South in the early 1970s, further developing their hard-driving, blues-rock sound and image, and experimenting with making studio recordings.\n\nDuring this time, they went through a number of member changes, with Van Zant, Collins and Rossington remaining the only constants. Burns and Junstrom left the band, and were briefly replaced by Rickey Medlocke on drums and Greg Walker on bass. In 1971, with this lineup, they made some recordings at the famous Muscle Shoals studio. By the time they made a second round of Muscle Shoals recordings in 1972, Burns had rejoined the band and Leon Wilkeson had become Larry Junstrom's permanent replacement on bass, with Medlocke and Walker having left to play with the southern rock band Blackfoot. Around this time, the band occasionally played shows with both Burns and Medlocke participating, utilizing a dual-drummer approach similar to that of The Allman Brothers. Also in 1972, roadie Billy Powell became the keyboardist for the band.\n\nPeak years (1973–1977)\n\nIn 1972 the band was discovered by musician, songwriter, and producer Al Kooper of Blood, Sweat, and Tears, who had attended one of their shows at a club in Atlanta. They changed the spelling of their name to \"Lynyrd Skynyrd\", (pronounced 'lĕh-'nérd 'skin-'nérd) and Kooper signed them to MCA Records, producing their first album (pronounced 'lĕh-'nérd 'skin-'nérd). Leon Wilkeson left just before the band was to record the album (Wilkeson rejoined the band shortly thereafter at Van Zant's invitation and is pictured on the album cover).[citation needed] Strawberry Alarm Clock guitarist Ed King joined the band and played Wilkeson's parts on the album, along with some guitar. King switched to guitar after the album's release, allowing the band to replicate the three-guitar mix used in the studio. Released January 1, 1973, the album featured the hit song \"Free Bird\", which received national airplay, eventually reaching #19 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, and is still considered a rock and roll anthem today.\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd's fan base continued to grow rapidly throughout 1973, largely due to their opening slot on The Who's Quadrophenia tour in the United States. On their 1974 follow-up, Second Helping, the band successfully avoided sophomore slump, with King, Collins and Rossington all collaborating with Van Zant on the songwriting. The album was the band's breakthrough hit, and featured their most popular single, \"Sweet Home Alabama\" (#8 on the charts in August 1974), a response to Neil Young's \"Alabama\" and \"Southern Man.\" (Young and Van Zant were not rivals, but fans of each other's music and good friends; Young even wrote the song \"Powderfinger\" for the band, but they never recorded it. Van Zant, meanwhile, can be seen on the cover of Street Survivors wearing a Neil Young t-shirt.) The album reached #12 in 1974, eventually going multi-platinum. In July of that year, Lynyrd Skynyrd was one of the headline acts at The Ozark Music Festival at the Missouri State Fairgrounds in Sedalia, Missouri.\n\nIn January, 1975, Burns left the band and was replaced by Kentucky native Artimus Pyle on drums. Lynyrd Skynyrd's third album, Nuthin' Fancy, was released the same year. The album had lower sales than its predecessor, and Kooper was eventually fired. Midway through the tour, Ed King left the band, citing tour exhaustion. In January 1976, backup singers Leslie Hawkins, Cassie Gaines and JoJo Billingsley (collectively known as The Honkettes) were added to the band, although they were not considered as official members. Lynyrd Skynyrd's fourth album Gimme Back My Bullets was released in the new year, but did not achieve the same success as the previous two albums. Van Zant and Collins both felt that the band was seriously missing the three-guitar attack that had been one of its early hallmarks. Although Skynyrd auditioned several guitarists, including such high-profile names as Leslie West, the solution was closer than they realized.\n\nSoon after joining Skynyrd, Cassie Gaines began touting the guitar and songwriting prowess of her younger brother, Steve. The junior Gaines, who led his own band, Crawdad (which occasionally would perform Skynyrd's \"Saturday Night Special\" in their set), was invited to audition onstage with Skynyrd at a concert in Kansas City on May 11, 1976. Liking what they heard, the group also jammed informally with the Oklahoma native several times, then invited him into the group in June. With Gaines on board, the newly-reconstituted band recorded the double-live album One More From the Road at the Fox Theatre (Atlanta, Georgia) in Atlanta, and performed at the Knebworth festival, which also featured The Rolling Stones.\n\nBoth Collins and Rossington had serious car accidents over Labor Day weekend in 1976 which slowed the recording of the follow-up album and forced the band to cancel some concert dates. Rossington's accident inspired the ominous \"That Smell\" - a cautionary tale about drug abuse that was clearly aimed towards him and at least one other band member. Rossington has admitted repeatedly that he's the \"Prince Charming\" of the song who crashed his car into an oak tree while drunk and stoned on Quaaludes. Van Zant, at least, was making a serious attempt to clean up his act and curtail the cycle of boozed-up brawling that was part of Skynyrd's reputation.\n\n1977's Street Survivors turned out to be a showcase for guitarist\/vocalist Steve Gaines, who had joined the band just a year earlier and was making his studio debut with them. Publicly and privately, Ronnie Van Zant marveled at the multiple talents of Skynyrd's newest member, claiming that the band would \"all be in his shadow one day.\" Gaines' contributions included his co-lead vocal with Van Zant on the co-written \"You Got That Right\" and the rousing guitar boogie \"I Know A Little\" which he had written before he joined Skynyrd. So confident was Skynyrd's leader of Gaines' abilities that the album (and some concerts) featured Gaines delivering his self-penned bluesy \"Ain't No Good Life\" - the only song in the pre-crash Skynyrd catalog to feature a lead vocalist other than Ronnie Van Zant. The album also included the hit singles \"What's Your Name\" and \"That Smell\". The band was poised for their biggest tour yet, including fulfilling Van Zant's lifelong dream of headlining New York's Madison Square Garden.\n\nPlane crash (1977)\n\nOn Thursday, October 20, 1977, just three days after the release of Street Survivors, and five shows into their most successful headlining tour to date, Lynyrd Skynyrd's chartered Convair 240 ran out of fuel near the end of their flight from Greenville, South Carolina, where they had just performed at the Greenville Memorial Auditorium, to LSU in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Though the pilots attempted an emergency landing on a small airstrip, the plane crashed in a forest in Gillsburg, Mississippi. Ronnie Van Zant, Steve Gaines, Cassie Gaines, assistant road manager Dean Kilpatrick, pilot Walter McCreary and co-pilot William Gray were all killed on impact; the other bandmembers suffered serious injuries.\n\nFollowing the crash and the ensuing press, Street Survivors became the band's second platinum album and reached #5 on the U.S. album chart. The single \"What's Your Name\" reached #13 on the single airplay charts in January 1978.\n\nThe original cover sleeve for Street Survivors had featured a photograph of the band, particularly Steve Gaines, engulfed in flames. Out of respect for the deceased (and at the request of Teresa Gaines, Steve's widow), MCA Records withdrew the original cover and replaced it with a similar image of the band against a simple black background. Thirty years later, for the deluxe CD version of Street Survivors, the original \"flames\" cover was restored.\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd disbanded after the tragedy, reuniting just once to perform an instrumental version of \"Free Bird\" at Charlie Daniels' Volunteer Jam in January 1979. Collins, Rossington, Powell and Pyle performed the song with Charlie Daniels and members of his band. Leon Wilkeson, who was still undergoing physical therapy for his badly broken left arm, was in attendance, along with Judy Van Zant, Teresa Gaines, JoJo Billingsley and Leslie Hawkins.\n\nHiatus (1977–1987)\n\nRossington, Collins, Wilkeson and Powell formed The Rossington-Collins Band, which released two albums between 1980 and 1982. Deliberately avoiding comparisons with Ronnie Van Zant as well as suggestions that this band was Lynyrd Skynyrd reborn, Rossington and Collins chose a woman, Dale Krantz, as lead vocalist. However, as an acknowledgment of their past, the band's concert encore would always be an instrumental version of \"Free Bird\". Rossington and Collins eventually had a falling out over the affections of Dale Krantz, whom Rossington married and with whom he formed the Rossington Band, which released two albums in the late 1980s and opened for the Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour in 1987-1988.\n\nThe other former members of Lynyrd Skynyrd continued to make music during the hiatus era.Leon Wilkeson on bass and  Billy Powellon keyboards played  in a Christian Rock band named Vision, touring with established Christian rocker Mylon LeFevre (who, like Skynyrd, had once opened for The Who). During Vision concerts, Powell's trademark keyboard talent was often spotlighted and he spoke about his conversion to Christianity after the near-fatal plane crash. Pyle formed The Artimus Pyle Band in 1982, which occasionally featured former Honkettes JoJo Billingsley and Leslie Hawkins.\n\nIn 1980 Allen Collins' wife Kathy died of a massive hemorrhage while miscarrying their third child. He formed the Allen Collins Band in 1983 from the remnants of the Rossington-Collins Band, releasing one tepidly-received album, but many around him believed that the guitarist's heart just wasn't in it anymore. Most point to his wife's death as the moment that Collins' life began to spin out of control; he spent several years bingeing on drugs and alcohol. In 1986 Collins crashed his car while driving drunk near his home in Jacksonville, killing his girlfriend and leaving him permanently paralyzed from the chest down. Collins eventually pled no contest to DUI manslaughter, but was not given a prison sentence since his injuries made it obvious that he would never drive or be a danger to society again.\n\nReturn (1987–present)\n\nIn 1987, Lynyrd Skynyrd reunited for a full-scale tour with five major members of the post-crash band: crash survivors Gary Rossington, Billy Powell, Leon Wilkeson and Artimus Pyle, along with guitarist Ed King, who had left the band two years before the crash. Ronnie Van Zant's younger brother, Johnny, took over as the new lead singer and primary songwriter. Due to Collins' paralysis from the 1986 car accident, he was only able to participate as the musical director, choosing Randall Hall, his former bandmate in the Allen Collins Band, as his stand-in. As part of his plea deal, Collins would be wheeled out onstage each night to explain to the audience why he could no longer perform (usually before the performance of \"That Smell\", which had been partially directed at him). Collins was stricken with pneumonia in 1989 and died on January 23, 1990.\n\nThe reunited band was meant to be a one-time tribute to the original lineup, captured on the double-live album Southern By The Grace Of God\/Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour - 1987. The fact that the band chose to continue after the 1987 tribute tour caused legal problems for the survivors, as Judy Van Zant Jenness and Teresa Gaines Rapp (widows of Ronnie and Steve, respectively) sued the others for violating an agreement made shortly after the plane crash, stating that they would not \"exploit\" the Skynyrd name for profit. As part of the settlement, Jenness and Rapp collect nearly 30% of the band's touring revenues (representing the shares their husbands would have earned had they lived), and hold a proviso which forces any band touring as \"Lynyrd Skynyrd\" to include at least two from among Rossington, Collins, Powell, Pyle, Wilkeson and King. Apparently, that proviso is not being enforced, seeing that Rossington is now the sole member of that group left in Lynyrd Skynyrd, as King was not allowed to remain in the band after missing a tour unable to tour due to heart problems, Pyle is on the outs with Rossington and Johnny Van Zant, and the others are now dead. Pyle has insisted in public appearances that \"Ronnie Van Zandt IS Lynyrd Skynyrd\", and wishes nothing to do with the current makeup of the band bearing that name. Two other founding members of the band remain alive, original drummer Bob Burns and bassist Larry Junstrom Bob Burns, but they have not participated in the post-crash band.\n\nThe reconstituted Lynyrd Skynyrd has gone through a large number of lineup changes and continues to record and tour today. One by one, the members of the pre-crash band have left, been forced out, or have passed away. Artimus Pyle left the band in 1991 and his place has been taken by a variety of drummers since, with Michael Cartellone finally becoming his permanent replacement. Randall Hall was replaced by Mike Estes in 1993. Ed King had to take a break from touring in 1996. In his absence, he was replaced by Hughie Thomasson. King has stated that his break from the band was to be temporary, but the band did not let him rejoin after he recovered. At the same time, Mike Estes was replaced by Rickey Medlocke, who had briefly played drums with the band in the early 1970's. Leon Wilkeson, Skynyrd's bassist since 1972, was found dead in his hotel room on July 27, 2001; his death was found to be due to emphysema and chronic liver disease. He was replaced in 2001 by Ean Evans. The remaining members released a double album called Thyrty which had songs from the original line up to the present. Lynyrd Skynyrd also released a live DVD of their Vicious Cycle Tour and on June 22, 2004, Lynyrd Skynyrd released the album Lyve: The Vicious Cycle Tour. On December 10, 2004, Lynyrd Skynyrd did a show for CMT, Crossroads, a concert featuring country duo Montgomery Gentry and other genres of music. In the beginning of 2005 Hughie Thomasson left the band to reform his disbanded Southern Rock band Outlaws. Thomasson died in his sleep on September 9, 2007 of an apparent heart attack in his home in Brooksville, Florida. He was 55 years old.\n\nOn February 5, 2005, Lynyrd Skynyrd did a Super Bowl party back in Jacksonville with special guests 3 Doors Down, Jo Dee Messina, Charlie Daniels and Ronnie and Johnny Van Zant's brother Donnie Van Zant of 38 Special. On February 13 of that year Lynyrd Skynyrd did a tribute to Southern Rock on the Grammy Awards with Gretchen Wilson, Tim McGraw, Keith Urban and Dickey Betts. On May 10, 2005, Johnny and Donnie Van Zant released a country album called Get Right with the Man which featured the hit single \"Help Somebody\". In the summer of 2005, lead singer Johnny Van Zant had to have surgery on his vocal cord to have a polyp removed. He was told not to sing for three months. On September 10, 2005, Lynyrd Skynyrd performed without Johnny Van Zant at the Music Relief Concert for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, with Kid Rock standing in for Johnny. In December 2005, Johnny Van Zant returned to sing for Lynyrd Skynyrd. The band performed live at Freedom Hall in Louisville, Kentucky, as a part of their 2007 tour. The concert was recorded in high definition for HDNet and premiered on December 1, 2007.\nThe band in 2008\n\nMark \"Sparky\" Matejka, formerly of the country music band Hot Apple Pie, joined Lynyrd Skynyrd in 2006 as Thomasson's replacement. On November 2, 2007, the band performed at Gator Growl, the world's largest student-run pep rally, in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium - also known as \"The Swamp.\" The event's 50,000-person attendance marked the largest crowd that Lynyrd Skynyrd had ever played in front of in the United States, until the July 2008 Bama Jam in Enterprise, Alabama where more than 111,000 people were in attendance.\n\nOn January 28, 2009, keyboardist Billy Powell died at age 56 at his home near Jacksonville, Florida. Powell called 911 at 12:55 a.m., complaining of shortness of breath. He had previously missed his doctor's appointment on the day before his death; the appointment was for a checkup on his heart. The EMS responders found Powell unconscious and unresponsive, with the telephone still in his hand. Rescue crews performed CPR, but he was pronounced dead at 1:52 a.m. Although a heart attack was suspected, and it was originally reported that an autopsy was to be performed, none in fact was ever done. Powell's death left Gary Rossington as the sole pre-crash member of the band, unless Rickey Medlocke's brief stint with the band in the early 1970's is counted. On March 17, 2009, it was announced that Skynyrd had signed a worldwide deal with Roadrunner Records, in association with their label, Loud & Proud Records, and released their new album God & Guns on September 29 of that year. They toured Europe and the United States in 2009 with Peter Keys of the 420 Funk Mob on keyboards and Robert Kearns of The Bottle Rockets on bass (in place of Ean Evans, who died of cancer at age 48 on May 6, 2009, at his home in Columbus, Mississippi). Scottish rock band Gun have been confirmed as special guests for the UK leg of Skynyrds tour in 2010.\n\nLeonard Skinner, the physical education teacher who inspired the name Lynyrd Skynyrd passed away on September 21st, 2010 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lynyrd+Skynyrd\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Radiohead are an English rock band formed in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards); brothers Jonny Greenwood (guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass); Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals); and Philip Selway (drums, percussion). Since 1994, they have frequently collaborated with producer Nigel Godrich and cover artist Stanley Donwood. Radiohead are noted for their experimental approach, which has influenced the development of alternative rock.\n\nThe band signed to EMI in 1991 and released their debut album, \"Pablo Honey,\" in 1993. Its lead single, \"Creep,\" became a worldwide hit. Their popularity and critical acclaim increased with \"The Bends\" in 1995. Their third album, \"OK Computer\" (1997), is widely regarded as a landmark album, noted for its complex production and themes of modern alienation. Their fourth album, \"Kid A\" (2000), marked a significant stylistic shift, incorporating elements of electronic music, jazz, classical music and krautrock. Though initially divisive, \"Kid A\" was later recognised as one of the decade’s best albums. \"Amnesiac\" (2001), recorded during the same sessions, followed, and \"Hail to the Thief\" (2003), their final album for EMI, combined rock and electronic music while addressing themes such as the war on terror.\n\nRadiohead self-released their seventh album, \"In Rainbows\" (2007), as a pay-what-you-want download, achieving critical and commercial success. Their eighth album, \"The King of Limbs\" (2011), explored rhythm through extensive looping and sampling. \"A Moon Shaped Pool\" (2016) featured prominent orchestral arrangements by Jonny Greenwood. Several members, including Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Selway and O'Brien, have released solo albums, and in 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood formed the band the Smile.\n\nBy 2011, Radiohead had sold over 30 million albums worldwide. They have received six Grammy Awards and four Ivor Novello Awards, and hold five Mercury Prize nominations, more than any other act. Seven of their singles have reached the top 10 on the UK singles chart: \"Creep\" (1992), \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" (1996), \"Paranoid Android\" (1997), \"Karma Police\" (1997), \"No Surprises\" (1998), \"Pyramid Song\" (2001) and \"There There\" (2003). \"Creep\" and \"Nude\" (2008) also reached the top 40 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Rolling Stone named Radiohead one of the 100 greatest artists of all time and included five of their albums in its \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" lists. Radiohead were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.\n\nStudio albums\nPablo Honey (1993)\nThe Bends (1995)\nOK Computer (1997)\nKid A (2000)\nAmnesiac (2001)\nHail to the Thief (2003)\nIn Rainbows (2007)\nThe King of Limbs (2011)\nA Moon Shaped Pool (2016) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Radiohead\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Biffy Clyro is an alternative rock band which formed in Kilmarnock, Scotland in 1995. The band consists of Simon Neil (vocals, guitar), James Johnston (bass, vocals) and his twin brother Ben (drums, vocals). The band has released eleven albums since their formation: \"Blackened Sky\" (2002), \"The Vertigo of Bliss\" (2003), \"Infinity Land\" (2004), \"Puzzle\" (2007), \"Only Revolutions\" (2010) , \"Opposites\" (2013) and \"Ellipsis\" (2016), \"Balance, Not Symmetry\" (2019), \"A Celebration of Endings\" (2020), \"The Myth of the Happily Ever After\" (2021), and \"Futique\" (2025). \"Balance, Not Symmetry\" is the soundtrack for the 2019 film by the same name and is not counted by the band as a studio album. \n\nBiffy, as they are often referred to, utilise a quiet\/loud dynamic, constructing songs that can range from a whisper-quiet pick on the guitar, to huge walls of noise with massive distortion and crashing drums. Their sound has simplified somewhat in recent times yet still occasionally contains complex time signatures and heavy riffs. While Simon Neil sings lead, all three members provide vocals. \"'Mon the Biffy!\" is a well known chant amongst Biffy fans; it is usually shouted in between songs at gigs, or before the band come on stage. Some fans have reacted poorly to the band's recent output. \n\nThe first incarnation of what would eventually become Biffy Clyro was formed in 1995 by fifteen-year-old Irvine-born, Ayr-raised guitarist Simon Neil, who recruited Kilmarnock-born Ben Johnston and someone known only as Barry on drums and bass respectively, calling themselves Screwfish. Barry was soon replaced by James Johnston, Ben's twin brother, and the three spent the next two years rehearsing, writing and covering songs. In 1997, they played their first gig as the support for a band called Pink Kross at a local youth centre. The trio then moved to Glasgow, where Neil went to the University of Glasgow and the Johnston twins went to Stow College, studying Electronics with Music and Audio Engineering respectively.They then progressed onto the bigger stage\n\nAfter playing gigs around Glasgow and receiving positive and enthusiastic reactions from the audiences, the band were spotted by Dee Bahl, who soon became their manager. Bahl offered them a chance to release an independent single on Aereogramme's Babi Yaga record label. \"Iname\" was released on 28 June 1999, and led to the band being chosen by Stow College's Electric Honey record label to release a record. thekidswhopoptodaywillrocktomorrow... was released on 13 June 2000, and after hearing it, BBC Radio Scotland DJ Vic Galloway gave the band airplay. A few days prior to the release of thekidswho..., the band were spotted at the Unsigned Bands stage at T in the Park 2000 by a Beggars Banquet representative. Soon after, the band was signed to the independent Beggar's Banquet, and on 30 October 2000, they re-recorded and released the single, \"27\", which became Kerrang!'s Single Of The Week.\n\nOn 1 October 2001, one of the songs from thekidswho... was re-recorded and released as a single, \"Justboy\". This was repeated on 4 February 2002, when the song \"57\" was released. On 11 March, the band's debut album, Blackened Sky, was released to generally positive reviews. It was around this time that the band began touring extensively, including being the support for Weezer on 20 March at the Barrowlands in Glasgow. On 15 July, the fourth single from the album, \"Joy.Discovery.Invention\" was released as a double A-side with a newly recorded song, entitled \"Toys, Toys, Toys, Choke, Toys, Toys, Toys\", which later appeared on The Vertigo of Bliss.\n\nIn 2003, the band retreated to the Linford Manor recording studio in Great Linford, Milton Keynes, England to record the follow-up to Blackened Sky. On 24 March, a new single was released entitled, \"The Ideal Height\", followed by another new single entitled \"Questions and Answers\" on 28 May. The band's second album, The Vertigo of Bliss was released on 16 June, to positive reviews, which focused on the more experimental style of the album in comparison to Blackened Sky, as well as the introduction of string sections.\n\nIn 2004, after touring relentlessly for The Vertigo of Bliss, the band retreated to Monnow Valley Studios in Monmouth, Wales to record a follow-up. As with the previous album, two singles were released before the actual album; \"Glitter and Trauma\" and \"My Recovery Injection\" on 9 August and 20 September, respectively. A digital download was also released; \"There's No Such Thing As A Jaggy Snake\", on 31 May. On 4 October, the band's third album, Infinity Land was released, and on 14 February 2005, the last single from the album, \"Only One Word Comes To Mind\" was released. On 16 February, the band performed a cover of Franz Ferdinand's \"Take Me Out\" live from Maida Vale on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show. Simon Neil's side project, Marmaduke Duke, also released an album in 2005, The Magnificent Duke, and toured the UK, along with the Johnston twins accompanying on bass and drums, for it.\n\nIn 2006, Biffy Clyro left Beggars Banquet and signed a deal with 14th Floor, an offshoot of Warner Bros. In June, the band contributed a cover of Weezer's \"Buddy Holly\" to Kerrang!'s High Voltage!: A Brief History of Rock, which came free with Issue #1110 of the magazine. In September, the band moved temporarily to Canada to record their fourth album at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, and The Farm Studio in Gibsons, which they finished doing in November. The song \"Semi-Mental\" was released as a digital download on 25 December. In 2007, the song \"Saturday Superhouse\" was released on 14 May, where it reached #13 on the UK Singles Chart; the band's highest single chart position to date. On 14 May, the song \"Living is a Problem Because Everything Dies\" was released, reaching #19 on the UK Singles Charts. On 21 May, Biffy were confirmed for T in the Park 2007, as well as being announced as one of the support bands for the 17 June gig at the new Wembley Stadium for Muse. On 1 June, Biffy were confirmed for Glastonbury 2007. On 4 June, Puzzle was released to critical acclaim, and eventually helped the band to reach their highest UK Albums Chart position ever, reaching #2 in the first week of release. On 6 June it was announced that Biffy were to support The Who at Marlay Park in Ireland. On 12 June, it was announced that \"Folding Stars\" was released as a single on July 16. On the 23rd of August 2007, Biffy Clyro were announced as the support act for the Red Hot Chilli Peppers at Hampden Stadium in Glasgow, for the Stadium Arcadium tour. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Biffy+Clyro\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"\nIggy Pop (born James Newell Osterberg, Jr.; April 21, 1947) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, and actor. Though widely known as an innovator and \"godfather\" of punk rock, Pop's music has encompassed a number of styles over the years, including pop, hard rock, jazz and blues. Pop became known as 'Iggy' in high school, during which time he served as drummer for local blues band The Iguanas. He is vocalist of influential proto-punk band The Stooges (Pop and the other surviving members of the group reunited in 2003), having become known, since the late 1960s, for his outrageous and unpredictable stage antics.\n\nThough his popularity has fluctuated through the years, many of Pop's songs have become well-known, including \"Lust for Life\", \"The Passenger\", \"Real Wild Child\", \"Candy\" (a duet with Kate Pierson of The B-52's), \"China Girl\", \"Nightclubbing\", \"Search and Destroy\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Dog\".\n\nIn 2010, The Stooges were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nPop was the lead singer of The Stooges, a late 1960s\/early 1970s band that featured brothers Ron and Scott Asheton and Dave Alexander and was highly influential in the development of hard rock. The debut album was produced by the Velvet Underground's John Cale. The band's \"I Wanna Be Your Dog\" is a garage punk standard.\n\nRaw Power was first released in1973, perhaps the first record that could truly be called punk. It was the confluence of The Stooges ages, hormones, creativity, ability, experience, tastes, lack of supervision, contempt for authority and ambition that has made Raw Power one of the most influential albums of all time.\n\nThe Stooges were infamous for performances in which Pop leapt off the stage (hence, the \"stage dive\"), smeared raw meat or peanut butter over his chest and cut himself with broken bottles. A glimpse of the vibrating intensity of Iggy live can be seen in the Ramones movie \"End of the Century.\" Guitarist James Williamson became a key collaborator, a partnership documented on the 1978 album Kill City.\n\nIn 25 years as a solo artist, Pop's best-known songs have included the thumping Lust for Life, to be heard on the soundtrack of the find-a-vein, shoot-it-up movie Trainspotting, I'm Bored and The Passenger (the latter based on a poem written by Jim Morrison). David Bowie played a key role in reinvigorating Pop's post-Stooges career and was a collaborator on the albums Lust for Life and The Idiot. Iggy may be under-rated as a songwriter. Bowie and Tina Turner covered his \"Tonight\". Bowie also put out his own version of \"China Girl,\" while Grace Jones covered the icey \"Nightclubbing\". <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Iggy+Pop\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"There are multiple artists tracked as \"Nirvana\" on Last.fm. Following are six, listed in order of prominence:\n\n1) Nirvana was a popular and highly influential American grunge band. The band formed in Aberdeen, Washington in 1987, and it was part of the Seattle grunge scene of the late 80s, alongside bands like Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden. As their popularity rose, alternative rock became a dominant genre on American and Canadian radio and music television during the early-to-mid '90s.\n\nIn late 1987, Cobain and Novoselic recruited drummer Aaron Burckhard (1987–1988).The three practiced material from Cobain's Fecal Matter tape.  After losing contact with Burckhard, the pair instead practised with Dale Crover of the Melvins, and Nirvana recorded its first demos in January 1988. Their first single, a cover version of \"Love Buzz\", a song by Dutch group 'Shocking Blue', was released in November 1988 on the Seattle independent record label Sub Pop. Their debut album, 'Bleach', was produced by Jack Endino and released in June 1989. Later that year, the band recorded the 'Blew EP' with producer Steve Fisk.\n\nAt the start of the new decade, the band commenced their first recording sessions to the follow-up album with producer Butch Vig, substituted their drummer by Dave Grohl and signed to DGC Records. The result, 'Nevermind', would eventually sell over seven million copies in the United States, and over 30 million worldwide.\n\nIn early 1993, Nirvana released \"Puss\"\/\"Oh, the Guilt\", a split single with The Jesus Lizard, on the independent label Touch & Go. Meanwhile, the group chose Steve Albini as the producer to record its third album. 'In Utero' debuted at number one on the Billboard album chart in September the same year. \n\nAs Nirvana's frontman, Cobain found himself referred to in the media as the \"spokesman of a generation\", with Nirvana the \"flagship band\" of \"Generation X\", their third studio album 'In Utero' was considered to be a conscious attempt to shed their audience. While Nirvana's mainstream popularity waned in the months following its release, their core audience cherished the band's dark interior, particularly after their 1993 performance on MTV Unplugged with the Meat Puppets, a band that Cobain had always idolised, performing with them the songs Oh, Me, Plateau and Lake of Fire. It was later released and topped the charts in 1994.\n\nNirvana's brief run ended with the suicide of Cobain in 1994, but the band's popularity expanded in the years that followed. Eight years after Cobain's death, \"You Know You're Right\", an unfinished demo that the band recorded two months prior to Cobain's death, topped radio playlists around the world. Since their debut, the band has sold more than fifty million albums worldwide, including more than ten million copies of Nevermind in the US alone. Nirvana remains a consistent presence on radio stations worldwide.\n\nIn 2004, the box set \"With the Lights Out\", a collection of radio sessions, home demos, studio demos and outtakes, was released. A year later, \"Sliver: The Best Of The Box\" was released, a compilation of selected \"WTLO\" tracks, but with 3 new tracks including a track from the famous \"Fecal Matter\" demo.\n\nBand members: Kurt Cobain - vocals, guitar (1987–1994), Krist Novoselic - bass (1987–1994) Dave Grohl - drums, vocals (1990–1994)\n\nPrior members:Aaron Burckhard - drums (1987–1988), Dale Crover - drums (1988, 1990),  Dave Foster - drums (1988), Chad Channing - drums (1988–1990), Jason Everman - guitar (1989), Dan Peters - drums (1990)\n\nTouring members: Pat Smear - guitar (1993–1994), Lori Goldston - cello (1993–1994), Melora Creager - cello (1994)\n\n---\n\n2) Nirvana is a UK-based progressive rock band formed in 1967, primarily active in the late 1960s and early 1970s - and still sporadically active to the present day.\n\nThe band was formed in the summer of 1967 in an era when melodic pop\/rock music with baroque and chamber arrangements and instrumentation was highly-prized. The band, consisted of two songwriter\/performers - Greek-born Alex Spyropoulos and Irish-born Patrick Campbell-Lyons who met in London. They produced a number of singles (notably \"Rainbow Chaser\", \"Pentecost Hotel\", and \"Tiny Goddess\") for the fledgling Island Records label.\n\nThe band was signed by Island Records' founder Chris Blackwell in the era when he also signed the bands Traffic and Free. \n\nIn October 1967 the band released its first album - a concept album produced by Blackwell titled The Story of Simon Simopath. The album was probably the first narrative concept album ever released - predating story-driven concept albums such as The Pretty Things' S.F. Sorrow (December 1968), The Who's Tommy (April 1969) and The Kinks' Arthur (September 1969).\n\nMusically, the group blended myriad musical styles including rock, pop, folk, jazz, Latin rhythms and classical music - primarily augmented by baroque chamber-style arrangements to create a unique entity.\n\nThe next year 1968 their follow-up album, All Of Us, featured a similar broad range of musical styles. Their third album To Markos III was released on the Pye label in 1969.\n\nIn 1971 the duo amicably separated for a while, with Campbell-Lyons the primary contributor to the next two Nirvana albums, Local Anaesthetic 1971, and Songs Of Love And Praise 1972. Campbell-Lyons subsequently worked as a solo artist and issued further albums: Me And My Friend 1973, Electric Plough 1981, and The Hero I Might Have Been 1983 though these did not enjoy commercial success.\n\nThe band reunited in 1985, successfully touring Europe and releasing a compilation album Black Flower 1987 containing some new material. (Black Flower had been the provisional title of their third album.) In the 1990s two further albums were released. Secret Theatre 1994 compiled rare tracks and demos, while Orange And Blue 1996 contained previously unreleased material including a tongue-in-cheek cover of the song \"Lithium\" originally recorded by the American grunge band Nirvana who released its first album in 1989, and who the band had successfully sued over use of the name Nirvana. The undisclosed terms of the settlement has apparently allowed the original Nirvana to continue using its name and issuing new recordings.\n\nIn 1999 the band released a three-disc CD anthology titled \"Chemistry\" including several previously-unreleased tracks and some new material.\n\nTop musicians who played on Nirvana sessions include: Lesley Duncan, Herbie Flowers, Billy Bremner (later of Rockpile\/Dave Edmunds fame), Luther Grosvenor, Wynder K. Frogg, Clem Cattini and the full lineup of rock band Spooky Tooth.\n\nThe group was in the school of baroque-flavored, melodic pop-rock music typified by The Beatles of \"Rubber Soul\" and \"Revolver\", The Beach Boys of Pet Sounds and God Only Knows, the Zombies of Odessey and Oracle and Time Of The Season, the Procol Harum of A Whiter Shade Of Pale, the Moody Blues of Days of Future Passed and Nights In White Satin and The Kinks of Waterloo Sunset. The majority of the tracks on Nirvana's albums fall into that broad genre of contemporary popular music - not easily categorized - but perhaps best described as the baroque or chamber strand of \"progressive rock, soft rock or \"orchestral pop\".\n\nTheir first three albums were reissued on CD by Universal in 2003 and received critical acclaim. In 2005 Universal (Japan) reissued Local Anaesthetic and Songs Of Love And Praise.\n\nAs of late 2005 the founding members Alex Spyropoulos and Patrick Campbell-Lyons are still sporadically writing and recording.\n\n---\n\n3) Nirvana was a short-lived Finnish punk band formed in 1980, whose sole release was a 7\" vinyl with tracks \"Kielletyt leikit\" and \"Kuljen kaupungilla\" with 200 pressings.\n\n---\n\n4) Nirvana was a Dutch pop group, formed in 1985 by producers Bernard Oattes and Rob van Schaik. The group consisted of Anthony Moendir, Frits Broekrits and Annie Alberti and have released one single, \"Say When\", which became a big hit. The group split up in 1987.\n\n---\n\n5) Nirvana is a side project of The Skaters' James Ferraro. Primitive droning drum beats and swirling synthesizers.\n\n---\n\n6) Nirvana was a Slovenian hard-rock band in the early seventies. They appear on several collections (YU Record Collector Dream, Boom Festival 72). <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Nirvana\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Pale Waves is an indie pop band from Manchester, England, United Kingdom. The band consists of Heather Baron-Gracie (vocals, guitar), Hugo Silvani (guitar), Charlie Wood (bass) and Ciara Doran (drums). \n\nHeather and Ciara met at BIMM Institute and formed the band Creek in 2013 with guitarist Ben Bateman and bassist Ryan Marsden. Their song “Lust” gained local popularity and received radio airplay, leading to a number of local gigs. In 2014, band changed its name to Pale Waves and Hugo and Charlie joined soon after, in 2015. Heather has said that the band name comes from the title of a painting owned by her grandmother.\n\nThey were signed to record label Dirty Hit in 2016 and their first two singles, 2017's \"There's a Honey\" and \"Television Romance\", were produced by Matthew Healy of labelmates The 1975. Their first EP, All the Things I Never Said, was released in February 2018. In September 2018, they released their debut album My Mind Makes Noises.\n\nEarly in 2019, the band shared plans to release an EP that year, but decided later to focus on their second album. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020—as well as the decision to approach the new album with a different stylistic direction inspired by the music of the 1990s and 2000s—delayed the production and release of new music until late 2020.\n\nThe band’s second album, Who Am I?, was released on February 12, 2021, preceded by the single \"Change”, which was released on November 10, 2020. It debuted at #3 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\n Unwanted, Pale Waves' third album, was released on August 12, 2022. The album was another stylistic leap for the band, this time adding pop punk influences to their evolving sound.\n\n Smitten, the band's 4th album was released on the 27th of September 2024 and steps more into the indie elements of their first two albums <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Pale+Waves\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Following the release of their fourth album \"Results May Vary\" (2003), Borland returned to record the EP \"The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)\" (2005) with Durst, Rivers, Lethal, and drummer Sammy Siegler before the band went on hiatus.

The lineup has included vocalist and guitarist Grohl, bassist Nate Mendel, guitarists Pat Smear and Chris Shiflett, keyboardist Rami Jaffee, and drummer Ilan Rubin. Former members have included guitarist Franz Stahl and drummers William Goldsmith, Taylor Hawkins, and Josh Freese.\n\nGrohl established Foo Fighters to release material he recorded after Nirvana disbanded in 1994, performing most of the instrumentation on the band’s self-titled debut album \"Foo Fighters\" (1995), which was recorded largely over six days. After attracting record label attention, he recruited Mendel and Goldsmith, formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate, and Smear, who had toured with Nirvana. The band’s first public performance took place in February 1995, several months before the album’s release.\n\nDuring the recording of the second album \"The Colour and the Shape\" (1997), Goldsmith departed and Grohl recorded most of the drum tracks; Smear left shortly afterward. They were replaced by Hawkins and Stahl, respectively. Stahl, previously a member of Scream alongside Grohl, was dismissed before the recording of the third album \"There Is Nothing Left to Lose\" (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until Shiflett joined after the album’s completion. Subsequent releases included \"One by One\" (2002), the double album \"In Your Honor\" (2005), divided between acoustic and heavier material, and \"Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace\" (2007).\n\nFor the seventh studio album \"Wasting Light\" (2011), produced by Butch Vig, Smear returned as a full-time member after regularly appearing with the band since 2005. \"Sonic Highways\" (2014) was issued as a soundtrack to a television miniseries directed by Grohl. \"Concrete and Gold\" (2017) became the band’s second album to reach number one in the United States and the first to feature Jaffee, previously a touring and session keyboardist, as a full member. Their tenth album, \"Medicine at Midnight\" (2021), preceded the death of Hawkins in March 2022. Freese performed with the band from 2023 to 2025, followed by Rubin from 2025 onward. The eleventh album, \"But Here We Are\", was released in June 2023.\n\nFoo Fighters have received 15 Grammy Awards, including five wins for Best Rock Album.

        "biografia":"There are at least 9 artists with this name:\n1. Willow Smith, an American pop singer\n2. An American instrumental group\n3. A Belgian indie rock band\n4. An American singer\/songwriter\n5. A Dutch rock band\n6. An American math rock band\n7. Sophie Wilson, a UK-based producer.\n8. German hard rock band, 1990s.\n9. A Canadian folk-roots band\n10. XO_willow☆, a bedroom punk artist\n\n1. Willow Camille Reign Smith (born October 31, 2000 in Los Angeles, United States) is an American child actress and singer who is the daughter of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith. She made her acting debut in 2007 in the film I Am Legend, and was most successful in the film Kit Kittredge: An American Girl where she won the Young artist award for Best Performance in a Feature Film. Apart from her acting she launched a music career in the fall of 2010 with the release of her debut single “Whip My Hair” and signing to Jay-Z’s record label Roc Nation. Willow has released 4 studio albums; her debut, ARDIPITHECUS released in 2015, The 1st released in 2017, WILLOW released in 2019 and lately I feel EVERYTHING released in 2021. She is also part of THE ANXIETY, a collaborative project with Tyler Cole. The projects debut album, THE ANXIETY, was released in 2020.\n\n2. Willow was a four piece instrumental group from Newnan, GA.\nKyle Coleman-Drums\/Fast Driving, Matt McClellan-Bass\/Keys\/Jingle Bells, Tanner Merritt-Guitar\/Funny Faces & Rob Sepanski-Mandolin\/Violin\/Noise \n\n3. Willow is a young Belgian indie rock band that started in 2007. They create solid, semi-danceable, catchy popsongs with hints of new wave. In their short existence Willow won several rockcontests, with most notably Rockvonk 2009. In 2010 they became 3rd in Humo’s Rock Rally and won the KBC public’s choice award. They are known for their energetic live performance and their refreshing take on music history while still being capable of maintaining their own sound.\n\n4. Willow is a self-taught singer\/songwriter, who, in 1992 put down her Bible and picked up a pawn shop guitar. Three chords later, the songs came flowing out. Judging from the fact that she had no subsequent musical experience, one could say she’s a bit of a preternatural chanteuse. Like post-Christian rocker contemporaries, Alice Cooper and Marilyn Manson, Willow’s papa is a preacher man and prior to her fateful leap, she was an enrollee at Multnomah School of the Bible in Portland Oregon. The result of her departure from conservative religion…her musical renderings are of an evolution of a spiritual nature - an earthly, poetic dance in the dark. For those familiar with the fire and brimstone of artist Nick Cave, Willow may be the polar sweet angel of darkness, redemption and desire.\n\n5. Willow was a rock-band from The Hague, The Netherlands. The band was formed by Marlein Heskes-Duarte and Rui Duarte. They’ve had multiple guitar players in the 6 years they made music. The music also changed everytime a new guitar player entered the band. Started out as an alternative rock band, they soon changed their sound to a more punk-rock sound, and in the last year added a nu-metal vibe to their sound.\nWillow had some succes in their hometown and surroundings, having played more than a 100 shows, including the Paard van Troje, Plein Open festival, HOT festival and recorded a videoclip in the local tv-studio “TV West” for the song Spinning Around.\nThe Duarte’s have recently started a new band called Man-Made Madness, which also includes ex-Willow guitar-player Jordy Licht.\n\n6. Willow is a math rock trio from Providence, Rhode Island, United States. Their debut EP, \"Roanoke\" was issued in 2012.\n\n7. Sophie Wilson AKA Willow first made her introduction in 2014 when her debut Feel Me caused a stir when ambient techno veteran Move D included it on his Fabric 74 mix. A year later, the song finally received a proper release on Workshop's compilation EP Workshop 21 – the sub-heavy house tune with an earworm R&B vocal was a highlight on the LP which was number 6 in Resident Advisor tracks of 2015.\n \nRewind two years to the start of an on-going residency in Nottingham for 808, the chance to play alongside Anton Zap, Fred P, Tama Sumo and of course Move D, have shaped and crafted her tastes and DJ style which ranges from house to techno and all that falls in-between.\n\n8. German hard rock band, 1990s. Frank Tauscher - vocals Stefan Iburg - guitar Matthias Franke - guitar\/keyboards Jens Beckmann - bass Ralf Striewski - drums.\n\n9. A folk roots band from Quadra Island, BC, Canada, Willow is the quartet of singer-songwriters Andrea Blaseckie, Maureen Fox, Trinity Gogolin and Kelly Beamish. Mixing old world styles with island flavor, heaps of instruments, and blending harmonies.\n\n10.

        "biografia":"María Natalia Lafourcade Silva (born 26 February 1984) is a Mexican pop and folk singer-songwriter who since her debut in 2003 has been one of the most successful singers in Latin America. Lafourcade's voice has been categorized as a lyric soprano.\n\nLafourcade was born in Mexico City, Mexico, surrounded by music and art. Her father is the Chilean musician Gastón Lafourcade who had French parents and her mother is the pianist María del Carmen Silva Contreras. Her uncle is the Chilean writer Enrique Lafourcade, a representative of the so-called \"Generation of the 50s\". She attended Instituto Anglo Español, a Catholic middle school, and studied painting, flute, theater, music, acting, piano, guitar, saxophone and singing. When she was 10, Natalia sang in a Mariachi group.\n\nShe grew up in Coatepec, Veracruz, Mexico, where she studied music with her mother, María del Carmen Silva Contreras, imitating artists such as Gloria Trevi and Garibaldi. Her mother studied piano with a specialty in musical pedagogy and is the creator of the Macarsi Method for musical training and personal development for children and educators. She adapted and practiced the method with Natalia to help her rehabilitate through music following a head injury from being kicked by a horse.  \n\nWhen she was 17, Loris Ceroni gave Lafourcade the opportunity to be in a pop\/rock group under his guidance. Lafourcade was hesitant, and Ceroni instead encouraged her to become independent. Lafourcade produced her first LP under the label of Sony Music. It was recorded in Italy and was cowritten with Aureo Baqueiro. Sabo Romo played in 2 songs. Natalia Lafourcade is a mix of pop, rock, bossa-nova and Latin rhythms. It features the songs \"Busca Un Problema\", \"Elefantes\", \"Te Quiero Dar\", \"Mírame, Mírate\", and her biggest hit, \"En El 2000\". \n\nIn 2005, she released Casa, her second album, but this time as Natalia y La Forquetina, the name of her band. Produced mostly by Café Tacuba's Emmanuel del Real, Casa presents a more mature, rock-oriented sound while retaining pop and bossa-nova influences on a few tracks, such as lead single \"Ser Humano\" (pop-rock) and its follow-up \"Casa\" (pop-bossa-nova). Aureo Baqueiro returned to produce the few tracks not produced by del Real.  More than a year after Natalia departed from La Forquetina, she recorded an instrumental album called The 4 Seasons of Love under Sony BMG label. She also wrote the Lyrics for \"Tú y Yo\" from Ximena Sariñana's self-titled album. \n\nIn 2009, she released the album Hu Hu Hu, a top 10 album in Mexico. The album was produced by Emmanuel del Real (who produced \"Casa\" in 2005), Marco Moreno and Ernesto García. It was nominated for Best female Pop Vocal Album at the 2009 Latin Grammy Awards (won by Laura Pausini) and Best Latin Pop album at the 2010 Grammy Awards (won by La Quinta Estación). Club Fonograma also named the album the second best of 2009, and the seventh best of the decade.\n\nIn 2012, she released a tribute album to Agustín Lara called Mujer Divina.\n\nHer next album, Hasta La Raíz, was released in March 2015. \"Nunca Es Suficiente\" (It's Never Enough), the first single off the album, was released on 10 February. The track \"Hasta La Raíz\" was No. 5 of the Viral 50 Global Spotify Chart and the No. 1 on the Viral 50 México chart.\n\nIn 2017, she recorded \"Remember Me\" as a duet with contemporary R&B singer Miguel for the credits of the movie Coco, and together they also performed the song at the 90th Academy Awards ceremony.\n\n2020 saw her release the eponymous Un Canto por México, Vol. 1.\n\nIn 2023, She won a Grammy for her album \" Un Canto Por México - El Musical\" <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Natalia+Lafourcade\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"There are multiple artists named Stellar:\n\n1. Stellar (스텔라)  was a South Korean girl group whose final lineup was composed of Minhee, Hyoeun, Soyoung and Youngheun. Formed in 2011 by The Entertainment Pascal, the group attracted attention as they were initially produced by Eric Mun of the boy band Shinhwa (신화). Following an unsuccessful debut with the single \"Rocket Girl\" in August 2011, Stellar underwent a line-up change and released \"UFO\" in February 2012, which fared similarly. The group began working with the production team MonoTree in July 2013 and released \"Study\", which experienced modest success and became their first single to chart in the top 100 of the Gaon Digital Chart.\n\nStellar gained notoriety in February 2014, when they adopted a more \"provocative\" image for the release of their first extended play Marionette. The album's title track peaked at number thirty-five on the Gaon Digital Chart, making it their most commercially successful single. This stylistic change in direction would be maintained in Stellar's subsequent releases \"Vibrato\" in 2015 and their second extended play Sting in 2016. With the addition of new member Soyoung, the group released their third and last extended play Stellar Into the World and its title track \"Archangels of the Sephiroth\" on June 27, 2017. On February 25, 2018, the group announced their disbandment in a fan-meeting after deciding to not renew their contracts with their agency.\n\n2. Stellar is  from a small town outside of Lowell, Massachusetts. His career launched on August 6th, 2019 with the release of his debut mixtape Bipolar. Almost a year later Stellar established himself as an upcoming artist with the release of his breakout Dark Pop single 'Ashes'. Stellar represents the city of Boston, trying to further the prominence of the city's sound in Hip Hop, R&B, and Pop. Some of Stellar's major influences range from the late rapper Juice WRLD, to the highly coveted pop band Maroon 5.\n\n3. Stellar is a band formed in 1995 in Rio de JaneiroBrazil with the end of the bands: Second Come, Drivellers and Stellarblast. The band members are: Fábio Leopoldino (ex-Second Come), Beatriz Lamego (ex-Drivellers), Cadu (ex-Drivellers) and Leandro Ferreira. They recorded their first demo “Thrumming Soothingly” in this year.\nIn 1997 Leandro leaves the band and Sol Moras (ex-Swallow 5) join the band in his place. They decided to record some new music and from that, \"Transmigrations\", their second demo was launched.\nTheir first full album, \"Ultramar\", was launched in 1999. In 2000 the band reunited to make their fourth show in six years. From the rehearsal for this show the band recorded their last album, \"4\". Today, 2007, some of the members are playing in shows with the band Pelvs. Official site: http:\/\/mmrecords.com.br\/200705\/stellar\/\n\n4. Stellar* is a band from New Zealand. In 1992, musicians Boh Runga and Andrew Maclaren moved to Auckland from Christchurch. Eventually with other musicians, initially guitarist Joel Haines they formed Stellar* in 1994. Originally a three piece they wrote their fist single Ride. This featured in a short film Headlong by Simon Raby. The band in its initial form didn't last. Later Runga and Maclaren came across bass player Kurt Shanks and reformed the band as a four piece.\nIn 1998 the band signed on with Sony BMG music NZ, later that year they released their first commecial single What You Do (Bastard). 1999 saw their first album release Mix, then the second-highest selling NZ album ever. The album was produced by ex-Thompson Twins singer Tom Bailey.\nMix would go on to gain Stellar* numorous accolades at New Zealand's 2000 Tui awards. It was also released in Australia, and resulted in Stellar* being a tour support for Alanis Morissette (who they got along well with) and Garbage (who they did not get along with, owing to similarities between the two bands). An extended version of Mix was also released, which featured a CD-ROM of three of their music videos.\nIn 2001 a follow-up album was released, Magic Line, a far more pop-rock based album than their first. After the release of a few singles from it, the band took an extended break, which due to different band members solo projects, took five years. Finally, 2006 bore release of their third album Something like Strangers.\n\n5. Stellar began life in 1995. The origins of the band lay with Ronan O'Hanlon and Martin Carroll who had been writing and recording together since 1991, developing their songwriting, and recording demos. They moved to Liverpool in 1995, by which time Sarah Mason (vocals), Graham Tonks (bass) and Shane Johnson (keyboards) had joined the band. A demo was sent to 4AD, who responded positively and signed Stellar for a one-off deal with Detox Artifacts where they released a 4-track CD. Stellar played the launch party for Detox at Disgracelands, London in September 1996. The audience included Liz Frazer, and Andrew Weatherall. The CD came out shortly afterwards. Stellar continued for another year, gigging up North at venues such as The Hacienda, Night and Day in Manchester and Liverpool Lomax. After a move to London, the band disbanded and Ronan and Martin are now based in London as The Sleepless.

        "biografia":"Recently signed to Big Machine\/John Varvatos Records (Big Machine Label Group), Friday Pilots Club is Chicago’s Pop affected and hard-hitting Rock band.\n\nFormed in 2017, members Caleb Hiltunen (vocals) and Drew Polovick (guitar) blend explosive memorable hooks and eclectic musical sensibilities to bring a fresh sound to the world of Rock music.\n\nWhile attending Columbia College Chicago and pursuing different degrees, Caleb and Drew became instant fans of each other’s work. Caleb – a talented lyricist and vocalist – and Drew – a songwriter, producer and master mixer - created the perfect musical partnership with Friday Pilots Club. They gained a loyal Chicago following before gaining the attention of Big Machine’s Scott Borchetta and John Varvatos in 2018.\n\nWhen Caleb and Drew sat down for their first writing session two years ago, their new single “Glory” was born. A deeply personal track, it was co-produced by Drew alongside Multi-Platinum selling producer John Fields (Switchfoot, American Hi-Fi, All Time Low) and Nothing But Thieves guitarist Dom Craik. A gospel tinged, Rock anthem, “Glory” was inspired from two different perspectives and allows for fans to create their own interpretation. Based on fear of one’s own mortality and the fight for change in the current political climate, “Glory” is available digitally now and is currently being introduced to radio.\n\nFriday Pilots Club recorded “Glory” and additional tracks at Field’s studio in Minneapolis. The environment inspired their creativity and allowed the band to explore diverse sonic possibilities while honing and developing their new sound. Finding influence from bands like Nothing But Thieves, Bring Me The Horizon, Royal Blood, Highly Suspect, along with a dose of The Strokes, Friday Pilots Club found comfort in heavier and darker music. Fans can hear the new music on streaming platforms and live at select tour dates.

        "biografia":"Since Citizen Soldier's debut in 2017, the Salt Lake City-based music group has been all about honoring those who fight battles every day that other dismiss or judge them for. Those battling mental illness, abuse, stigmatization, and being ostracized have embraced their music as a representation of their own stories and struggles. As the community has grown and word has spread, many have found a refuge of survivors to share in their pain.\n\n\"This Is Your Sign\" captures a pivotal moment for Citizen Soldier. The 24-song dual album is an emotional rollercoaster through the shared experiences of the group and its fans. It navigates wide spectrum of emotions, ranging from complete worthlessness to grateful celebration of one's darkest days. After this exploration into a brutally beautiful journey, the song of the same name ends the album as a direct statement to every listener; no matter your nationality, gender, age, sexual orientation or past mistakes - you have found the answers to the questions you have been left alone with far too long.\n\n--\nCitizen Soldier will always be there for those wondering if they are worth saving. Too many suffer in silence, waiting for a miracle that never comes; so we did our best to create one. We hope \"This Is Your Sign\" makes you feel the way it made us feel while writing it - because all life is precious and worth fighting for.\n\n;\n\n-CS <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Citizen+Soldier\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Some of her hits include \"Tormento\", \"Amor completo\", \"Si tú me quisieras\", \"Tu falta de querer\", \"Amárrame,\" and \"Mi buen amor.\" Laferte has won four Latin Grammy Awards (the most for a Chilean artist), two MTV Europe Music Awards, and has been nominated twice for the Grammy Awards.\n\nIn 2003, Laferte, then known as Monserrat Bustamante, entered the Chilean reality competition series Rojo.

        "biografia":"John Clayton Mayer was born October 16, 1977, in Fairfield, Connecticut, USA, and started playing guitar at 13 after being inspired by a Stevie Ray Vaughan tape his neighbor gave him. In 1998 he moved to Atlanta, Georgia where he refined his skills and gained a following.\n\nIn 2003, he won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for the 2002 single \"Your Body Is a Wonderland\" from the album Room for Squares.\n\nIn February 2005, he was awarded the Song of the Year Grammy for his song Daughters, which he composed while in the shower, from the album Heavier Things. In winning the award, he beat out such contenders as Alicia Keys, and Kanye West. He dedicated this award to his grandmother, Annie Hoffman, who died in May 2004. He also won Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, for which Elvis Costello, Prince and Seal were also nominated. In 2007, John won 2 Grammys, one for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, for the song \"Waiting On The World To Change,\" and also Best Pop Vocal Album for his album Continuum.\n\nTo date, Mayer has toured with many groups, including Maroon 5, Guster, Counting Crows, The Wallflowers, Teitur, Ben Folds, and Sheryl Crow.\n\nIn 2004, Mayer worked with hip hop artist and producer Kanye West, appearing both on Go and Kanye West's Bittersweet (released in the summer of 2007 as an iTunes pre-order bonus track to the album Graduation) and received praise from rap heavyweights like Jay-Z and Nelly. When asked about his ubiquitous presence in the hip hop community, he said, \"It's not music out there right now. That's why, to me, hip-hop is where rock used to be.\"\n\nIt was around this time that he began hinting at a change in his musical interests, announcing that he was \"closing up shop on acoustic sensitivity.\" In 2005, he began a string of collaborations with various blues artists, including Buddy Guy, BB King, Eric Clapton and jazz artist John Scofield. He also toured with the legendary jazz pianist Herbie Hancock, which included a show at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee.\n\nAlthough Mayer has maintained a reputation for being a sensitive singer-songwriter, he is also an accomplished guitarist influenced by the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, Freddie King and B.B. King.  In this regard, he has released an album with his band The John Mayer Trio Try!, which features a blues-rock style reminiscent of Jimi Hendrix.\n\nIn September 2006, Mayer released his third studio album, Continuum.  The album, written and produced exclusively by Mayer (with the help of Steve Jordan from the John Mayer Trio) is a culmination of Mayer's growth as an artist and continues with the blues-rock style that he began to flirt with on Try!.\n\nAlso notable is John Mayer's various adaptations in style. He always maintained a blues tone, he introduced a rockier edge. However, in Continuum, he adopts a calmer genre, returning to his previous styles. \n\nOn November 17, 2009, Mayer's fourth studio album, Battle Studies, was released and debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 album chart. The album consists of 11 tracks with a total time of 45 minutes. The first single from the album, \"Who Says\", was released on September 24, 2009 in advance of album, and was followed on October 19 by the single \"Heartbreak Warfare\" and the single \"Half of My Heart\" released on June 21, 2010. Despite the album's commercial success, critics were mixed with their praise; while some reviews were glowing, calling it his \"most adventurous\", others called the album \"safe\" and noted that \"Mayer the singer-songwriter and Mayer the man about town sometimes seem disconnected, like they don't even belong in the same body.\n\nFollowing his recovery from vocal surgery, Mayer returned to the studio. On June 18, 2013, Mayer announced from his Facebook page that his sixth album, Paradise Valley, would be released on August 13, 2013. On the same day, he released a lyric video for the new album's first single, \"Paper Doll\", on his YouTube page. The release date was later changed to August 20, 2013. \"Who You Love\" featuring Katy Perry followed as the album's third single and a music video was released on December 17, 2013 for the song. The album, which also includes a collaboration with Frank Ocean, was met with positive reviews from music critics. Mayer embarked on a tour, his first in three years, in support of Born and Raised and Paradise Valley. The American leg of the tour ran from July to December 2013 with Interscope recording artist Phillip Phillips serving as support act. The tour will visit Australia in April 2014. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/John+Mayer\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

They later recruited bassist Brennen Bates and drummer Cole Carson.\n\nWeathers released their debut album, \"Kids in the Night\", in 2016 as a two-part EP. Boyer said of the album \"It's about accepting your flaws and realizing that the so-called 'bad' things about you are actually what shape you into who you are now — a stronger, better person. It's asking, 'Are the bad things really bad or are they just temporarily hard?\".\n\nFollowing the release of their debut album, Weathers released numerous singles in 2019, 2020, and 2021, with \"Losing Blood\", \"C'est la vie\", \"Rehab\", and \"Karma\" featuring as songs on their second album \"Pillows & Therapy\", which was released on August 13, 2021.\n\nIn 2022 the band signed with Sumerian Records and released the following singles before their third album, \"Where Do I Sign?\", \"ALL CAPS feat John the Ghost\" and \"She Hates Me\". Their third album \"Are We Having Fun?\" was released on May 5, 2023. \n\n2) Born at the end of the year 2009 in Corinthos, Greece, but based in the greek city of Patras since 2010, Weathers are a dynamic heavy trio that worships jamming fuzzy tripped out sludgy tunes and mostly enjoys sharing with live audience their downtuned psych stoner rock and doomy desert melodies. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Weathers\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Martin's brother Stephan Eicher (guitar, synthesizer) and Claudine Chirac (saxophone) supplemented the group temporarily in live appearances and recordings.\nAfter ten concerts, four singles and an album the group split up at the end of 1982. GT and Marco Repetto formed together with the former Glueams guitarist Martin Pavlinec and the drummer Dominique Uldry, the band „Missing Link“, later „Eigernordwand“. GT supplemented the futurism oriented performance group „Red Catholic Orthodox Jewish Chorus “ around performance artist Edy Marconi, in which occasionally Marco Repetto also played.

Marco Repetto started in 1989 a new career as Techno and Ambient DJ, musician and producer (a.o. mittageisen v2). The band is most famous for their 1981 hit \"Eisbär\" (\"Polar Bear\"), which was later covered by the French band Nouvelle Vague.

        "biografia":"Evanescence is a rock band founded in Little Rock, Arkansas, United States in 1995 by singer\/pianist Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody (who left in 2003). \n\nAfter recording private albums, the band signed to Wind-up Records and released their first full-length album, Fallen, in 2003, which sold more than 15 million copies worldwide and helped the band win two Grammy Awards. A year later, they released their first live album, Anywhere But Home, which sold more than one million copies worldwide. In 2006, they then released their second studio album, The Open Door, which sold more than five million copies. They released their third and latest studio album, Evanescence in 2011.\n\nThe band currently consists of Amy Lee (lead vocals, piano, keyboards), Terry Balsamo (guitars), and Tim McCord (bass). Former members include David Hodges (piano, keyboards, backing vocals; left in 2002), Ben Moody (guitars; left in 2003), William Boyd (bass; left in 2006), John LeCompt (guitars, backing vocals; fired in 2007), and Rocky Gray (drums; left in 2007). Session members include Troy McLawhorn (guitars) and Will Hunt (drums), both are from Dark New Day, they were \"borrowed\" to replace LeCompt and Gray during 2007 tours.\n\nAmy Lee and Ben Moody met in 1994 at a youth camp in Little Rock, where Moody heard Lee playing I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That) by Meat Loaf on the piano. Their first songs were Solitude and Give Unto Me, written by Lee, and Understanding and My Immortal, written by Moody.\n\nTwo of Lee and Moody's songs found playtime on local radio stations, raising local awareness of the group and demand for a show. The band eventually appeared live, and became one of the most popular acts in the area. After experimenting with band names, such as Childish Intentions and Stricken, they decided on Evanescence, which means \"disappearance\" or \"fading away\" (from the word evanesce, which means \"to disappear\"). Lee has stated she loves the name because \"it is mysterious and dark, and places a picture in the listeners' mind.\".\n\nTheir first full-length demo CD, Origin (released in 2000), is relatively unknown. The band also released two EPs. First, the self-titled Evanescence EP (1998) of which about 100 copies were made, and second the Sound Asleep EP, also known as the Whisper EP (1999), limited to 50 copies. Origin and the EPs contain demo versions of some of the songs on their debut album, Fallen. For example, the recording of My Immortal found on Fallen can also be found on Origin, minus a handful of additional string accompaniments. Only 2,500 copies of this record were produced; in response, Lee and Moody encouraged fans to download the band's older songs from the Internet.\n\nIn several interviews Amy has said that 'Origin' was not an album, it was merely meant to be a demo. While appearing to be an official CD, it was never meant to be officially released.  According to Amy Lee \"Origin is not an album.  Should I say that clearer?  'Origin' is not an album.  We recorded its demos, we recorded it a long time ago, in Ben's apartment or in my parent's attic with an 8-track recorder that cost $300.  It sounds like crap. Don't feel bad that you don't have it, just download it.  It looks kind of like an album because we had an artist make us this cool album cover because we were shopping it to record labels.  We put everything we had on there, and some songs that are on there are on 'Fallen', just done right\". The video of this interview can be seen here.\n\nThe band sent 'Origin' to several record labels, and eventually Wind-Up Records signed them. The band then recorded a large collection of demos throughout 2001 and 2002. Afterwards, the band began work on their second full-length album. However, after the album had been finished, Hodges left the band in December of 2002.\n\nThe album, entitled 'Fallen', was then released in March 2003. It brought the band international fame, selling 14 millions of copies worldwide. 'Fallen' has since gone 6 times platinum in the United States and has sold more than 15 million copies altogether worldwide.\n\nHowever, shortly after, Moody left the band on October 22 of 2003 due to internal struggles with the band members. He was then replaced by guitarist Terry Balsamo from the band Cold. Before Moody's departure, Gray, LeCompt, and Boyd had been session members, but afterwards they became full-time members.\n\nAt the 2004 Grammy Awards, Evanescence won Best New Artist and Best Hard Rock Performance for their single Bring Me to Life, known worldwide from the Daredevil soundtrack. That same year, the band released a live CD\/DVD entitled 'Anywhere But Home', which also sold 1 million of copies worldwide and has since gone platinum in the United States.\n\nAfterwards, the band began work on their next release. Many things set the release back, including the health problems of Terry. He was unfortunately affected by a stroke, but is recovering successfully. Amy also fired their old manager which they had relations with during 'Fallen', and brought him to court. In 2006, they finished recording their second album, titled 'The Open Door', as well as shooting a video for the single Call Me When You're Sober. On July 13th, 2006, Lee announced through Evanescence's online message board that bassist Boyd has decided to leave the band in order to make time for his personal life and family. Tim McCord was announced as Will Boyd's replacement in August 2006.\n\n'The Open Door' debuted at number 1 in Australia, United States, Greece, Germany, and Switzerland. It sold over 1 million copies worldwide within the first week of its release.\n\nThe second single of 'The Open Door' was Lithium. A video was shot for the single - directed by Paul Fedor (who has worked with Marilyn Manson, Seether, and Deftones). It took 2 days to film, October 31 and November 1, 2006.\n\nThe third single off 'The Open Door' was Sweet Sacrifice.  The label, Wind-Up, had originally chosen All That I'm Living For to be the third single, but was met with opposition from the fans.  The video was shot on March 9th and 10th, 2007.  Directed by Paul Brown.\n\nOn May 4, 2007, John LeCompt announced that he had been fired from Evanescence, and also stated that drummer Rocky Gray had decided to quit as well. Both musicians posted on their personal MySpace pages to confirm the news report, however, neither elaborated about the circumstances surrounding their departures, and no official statement has yet been released by the band or label.\n\nOn his MySpace blog, LeCompt stated that Lee called his cellphone to fire him, and that no warning had previously been given nor were any negotiations made available. No replacements have been named as of yet, but Evanescence says they will continue touring and producing music.\n\nLee revealed during the taping of MuchMusic's January 9, 2007 episode of Live @ Much that she had become engaged the previous evening. She later confirmed on EvThreads.com that she was proposed to by Josh Hartzler, a 29-year-old therapist and long time friend. She noted in an interview that the songs Good Enough and Bring Me To Life were inspired by him. The couple were married on May 6, 2007, and honeymooned near The Bahamas. She has posted on EvThreads that she is \"now officially Mrs. Amy Hartzler.\"\n\nRecently Lee and Evanescence (with temporary members) headlined a one off show in Sao Paulo, Brazil for a music festival. A couple of weeks before, Lee posted on her Twitter that the band need to practice and was going to play a secret show in NYC's The Palace.\n\n Lee confirmed that a third album was on the way and was set to release late 2010. A short video surfaced on one members Twitter account showing the band practicing and recording.\n\nOn 22 January, 2010, Amy posted on her Twitter that the b-side Together Again would be a gift to all who donate just the minimum amount to the Relief Effort over in Haiti.\n\nIn a MTV interview Amy Lee announced that the new album would be named 'Evanescence'. This was released October 11th, 2011. It is the first of their albums to have a deluxe version with 4 extra songs and an accompanying DVD.\n\nLost Whispers is a compilation album and was released on December 9, 2016, by The Bicycle Music Company. The album is a career-spanning collection of B-sides and two new recordings: \"Lost Whispers\", the intro from the band's 2009 tour and a new version of \"Even in Death\", originally on their 2000 demo album, Origin.\n\nTheir fourth Studio album, Synthesis, was released in November 2017. The album debuted at number 8 on the Billboard 200, and has reached number 23 in the UK, 5 in Germany, and 6 in Australia.\n\nDiscography\n1998: Evanescence EP\n1999: Sound Asleep EP\n2000: Origin\n2003: Mystary EP and Fallen (first official studio album)\n2004: Anywhere But Home\n2006: The Open Door\n2011: Evanescence\n2016: Lost Whispers\n2017: Synthesis\n2021: The Bitter Truth\n\nOfficial site: www.evanescence.com <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Evanescence\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Edgar Nathaniel Sarratt III, known professionally as midwxst, is an American rapper and singer born on June 5, 2003, in Columbia, South Carolina. Raised in Indianapolis, Indiana, Sarratt grew up in a military family and faced various relocations, which instilled adaptability and resilience. He was diagnosed with ADHD at a young age, which influenced his approach to music and creativity. In high school, he began producing music in his bedroom, initially under the alias $uspect, and later adopting the stage name midwxst.\n\nmidwxst first gained attention in the hyperpop community on SoundCloud, where he released a series of tracks that reflected influences from hyperpop, emo rap, trap, and pop. His 2020 single \"Trying,\" a breakout hit within the genre, led to a record deal with Simple Stupid Records, a Geffen Records imprint. That year, he also released the EPs valentine and Secrets, the latter marking his debut on major streaming platforms and featuring collaborations with notable hyperpop artists. His work from this period demonstrated a blend of genres, drawing from influences like Kanye West, Tyler, the Creator, and Frank Ocean, while incorporating elements of electronic music, hip hop, and alternative rock.\n\nThroughout 2021 and 2022, midwxst continued to build his discography with releases like SUMMER03, wxstnb, and his debut major-label EP, BACK IN ACTION, followed by better luck next time and BACK IN ACTION 3.0, which included collaborations with artists such as BabyTron and tana. In 2023, he collaborated with rapper Denzel Curry on the single \"Tally,\" which prefaced the release of his debut studio album, E3, on September 1. The album, co-executive produced by midwxst and Sophie Gray, explores themes of love, personal growth, and mental health, which are recurrent topics in his work.\n\nKnown for his openness about his struggles with mental health and experiences with bullying, midwxst’s music often emphasizes themes of resilience and self-acceptance. He aims to provide a voice for listeners dealing with similar challenges, combining introspective lyrics with diverse musical styles. With E3, midwxst sought to deepen this connection with fans by crafting a concept album centered on relationships and personal transformation. As he continues his career, midwxst is recognized as one of the emerging voices from the pandemic-era hyperpop movement, known for his genre-blending approach and commitment to emotional transparency in his music. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/midwxst\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Dead Sara is an American alternative rock band from Los Angeles, California. Formed in 2002, the band currently consists of Emily Armstrong, Siouxsie Medley and Sean Friday. Best known for their single \"Weatherman\" from their debut eponymous album Dead Sara; they released their second album, Pleasure to Meet You, in 2015. They signed with Atlantic Records in 2017, and released an EP, Temporary Things Taking Up Space in 2018. Armstrong and Medley met through a mutual friend in 2002, at ages 16 and 15 respectively. The pair began writing songs together in 2003, and in 2004 completed their first studio recording with the song \"Changes\". Their first live performance as a band was in March 2005 at The Mint nightclub in Los Angeles, with Armstrong playing bass. Having briefly gone by the name Epiphany, in mid-2005 they changed their name to Dead Sara as a reference to the Fleetwood Mac song \"Sara\" and its lyric \"...said Sara\", which the band misheard as \"dead Sara\". Both Armstrong and Medley have publicly cited Stevie Nicks, the singer and writer of the song \"Sara\", as a primary influence. Around this time Medley began styling her first name as \"Siouxsie\", as a nod to the Sioux Indians tribe and the Native American heritage of one of her great-grandparents (rather than a reference to the musical artist Siouxsie Sioux). In 2007, Dead Sara began their first tour as the opening act for Endless Hallway. They released the six-song EP The Airport Sessions on Viscount Records in 2008. After numerous changes to the drummer and bass player positions, the band’s line-up finally coalesced in 2009 with Sean Friday on drums and Chris Null on bass, both of whom previously played with Sonny Moore (currently known as Skrillex). In 2009 Armstrong was commissioned by Hole frontwoman Courtney Love to sing backing vocals on Love's 2010 album Nobody's Daughter. In 2011, when singer Grace Slick was asked by The Wall Street Journal which contemporary female singers she admires, Slick named Armstrong. In 2010, the band started their own label, Pocket Kid Records, set up as a subsidiary of Interact-TV, Inc. and owned by Armstrong and Medley. In April 2012, the band released their debut eponymous album through the label, Pocket Kid Records, produced by Noah Shain. The album peaked at No. 16 on Billboard's Heatseekers Albums chart. Soon after, \"Weatherman\" was used by Fiat in their \"Fiat 500 Abarth Burning Up the Desert\" advertisement. Dead Sara received the \"Best New Rock Group\" award at the third annual Vegas Rocks! Magazine Music Awards 2012 on August 26, 2012. They were also nominated for a Radio Contraband Rock Radio Award as Indie Artist of the Year in 2012, and were voted the 98.7 FM 2012 Close to Home Artist of the Year, defeating No Doubt in the final round. \"Weatherman\" topped the Loudwire \"10 Best Rock Songs of 2012\" list, beating several major bands including Three Days Grace, Stone Sour, and Deftones. Both Armstrong and Medley were nominated as top ten finalists in the Loudwire 2012 top vocalist and top guitarist awards respectively. Additionally, Armstrong was nominated for the Loudwire 2012 Rock Goddess of the Year award. The band went into the studio at the beginning of 2014 to work on their second album, once again with producer Noah Shain. The record did not see the light of day until the following year due to alleged issues with Epic Records. The band and the label parted ways sometime in 2014. In December 2014, Dead Sara announced that they would be releasing their second album Pleasure to Meet You in March 2015, on their own Pocket Kid Records label. The band also announced they would be using PledgeMusic for those who wanted to pre-order the album. One track, \"Suicidal\", was given as a free download to all those who pre-ordered the album or bought any of the various memorabilia and other merchandise from the PledgeMusic campaign. The album's release was followed by a short headlining tour. Bassist Chris Null then left the band. In 2015, Dead Sara's cover of Nirvana's \"Heart-Shaped Box,\" recorded for Infamous Second Son, won the award for \"Best Song, Original or Adapted\" at the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR) annual awards program. In another trailer for Infamous: Second Son, their own song \"Weatherman\" was also used. Dead Sara signed with Atlantic Records in 2017, and announced plans for a new EP. The six-song EP Temporary Things Taking Up Space was released on June 8, 2018.\n\n\nhttp:\/\/www.deadsara.com <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Dead+Sara\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"There are several artists who have recorded under the name \"Mammoth\", including: \n\n1. American hard\/alternative rock band. \n2. British hard rock band. \n3. New Zealand progressive metal band. \n4. American post-rock\/shoegaze band. \n5. American hard rock band which changed names to Van Halen. \n6. Australian stoner\/southern metal band. \n7. American rapper. \n8. Brazilian heavy metal band. \n\n1. Mammoth (formerly Mammoth WVH) is the music project of former Van Halen bassist Wolfgang Van Halen. The debut single \"Distance\" was released on 16. November 2020 and peaked at #1 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart in February 2021. Mammoth WVH's debut album was released on 11, June 2021.\n\nMammoth WVH is an American rock band formed and fronted by Wolfgang Van Halen. The band name is a reference to both Wolfgang's initials and Mammoth, an earlier band that featured his father Eddie and uncle Alex prior to forming Van Halen. Wolfgang formed Mammoth WVH initially as a solo project while he was still a part of Van Halen, but became his full-time band after their disbandment in 2020 as a result of Eddie's death. To date, the band has released two albums: Mammoth WVH (2021) and Mammoth II (2023).\n\nWolfgang Van Halen chose the band's name to be Mammoth WVH, as a derivative of his father's first band named Mammoth, which eventually evolved into Van Halen. Wolfgang said that the concept for the name came from a combination of inspirations. As a child, he grew up hearing the name of his father's former band believing, \"That's the coolest name! When I grow up, I want to call my own band that.\" The younger Van Halen admired that Eddie had a multi-faceted role including serving as the original lead singer of Mammoth, and with his intentions to solely write, perform, and produce the album, he settled on the name. Upon settling on the title, he presented his idea to his father who responded to it with immense positivity and gave his blessing. Wolfgang eventually dropped the WVH suffix and continued as Mammoth after obtaining legal rights to the name. \n\n2. After the split of Gillan in 1982, the bearded John McCoy (bass guitar; 19 stone) recruited session musicians 'Tubby' Vinnie Reed (drums; 22 stone), 'Big' Mac Baker (guitars; 24 stone) and Nicky Moore (vocals; 20 stone and 5'6\") for his solo project.\nInitially christened 'Dinosaur', they changed their names after complaints from a similarly titled California blues outfit.\nChanging their name to 'Mammoth', the band toured with Whitesnake and Marillion and were generally well-received by fans, although an \"incident\" in Leeds meant that the band had to request a specially reinforced stage at all future gigs, due to the concentrated pressure of some 1200 pounds (plus  allowance for on stage exuberance).\nAfter a few years of touring without hitting the big-time in the manner of their contemporaries, the band decided to call it a day, and moved onto other solo projects.\n\nThe band appeared in the 1988 film Just Ask For Diamond, where they played the henchmen of the Fat Man (Michael Robbins). \n\n3.  Mammoth first formed in late 2006 with the current line-up (louis - vocals & violin, geoff - guitar, richard - guitar, benjamin - bass & warwick - drums) coming together in October 2008. Mammoth delivers haunting passages that shift into crushing rhythms, with sparse yet soaring vocals to give insights into, and reflections of, our own pale existence. Mammoth has just released their debut, self-titled EP, 'Mammoth' (2009). The band is focusing on new material and is currently unsigned. \n\n\n4. Mammoth is a post rock\/ambient\/shoegaze band based out of Pekin Illinois.  There debut split came out in 09 with Drifts. \n\n5. The band Van Halen was formerly known as Mammoth from 1972-1974 when the band consisted of Eddie Van Halen, Alex Van Halen, and Mark Stone; later David Lee Roth would join and Mark Stone would be fired and Michael ANthony would be brought in. The band would soon discover there was another band by the name of Mammoth and Dave would suggest they change the name to Van Halen. \n\n6.  MAMMOTH were born in early 2006 and consist of 5 like-minded musicians, from the Adelaide area, who really do love what they play. Terrorizer magazine once said \"Mammoth's riffs should be housed in the natural history museum!!\". The band has an incredible hard rock sound, while at the same time, have a heaviness and catchy-ness that rival the heavist bands one could think of, while still maintaining a very organic feel and sound to the songs that seem to capture the attention of all who hear or see MAMMOTH. They are in the same genre as DOWN, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, CROWBAR, SABBATH, SKYNYRD etc etc...kinda stoner rock\/southern metal . They licensed our 1st album \"The Calling\" to a small indie aussie label called Wolfcastle Records and it was released here in Oz and New Zealand on December 10, 2010, as well as itunes and is distributed through MGM, through Green Media. \n\n7. Mammoth is a rapper from the town of Sodus, NY. He raps throughout the Monroe county Area and is on his way up. \n\n8. Mammoth is a heavy metal band from Brazil.\nThey formed in 1984, released Possessed 7'' and a track in the São Power compilation (1986). <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Mammoth\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Mogwai is a Scottish post-rock\/instrumental band from Glasgow formed in 1995. \nThey compose lengthy, mostly instrumental guitar-based pieces in the style of post-rock, usually focused around the elaboration of a single theme, and are known traditionally for their quiet\/loud dynamic, defined bass riffs, and an eminent ambient sound, sometimes dark and sometimes grand. Although frequently referred to as post-rock, the band have revealed in interviews that they despise this categorization, insisting that their sound bears little resemblance to pioneers of the genre, such as Tortoise. \n\nMembers:\nStuart Braithwaite – guitar, bass, vocals (1995–present)\nDominic Aitchison – bass, guitar, keyboards (1995–present)\nMartin Bulloch – drums (1995–present)\nBarry Burns – guitar, keyboards, bass, synthesizer, flute, vocals (1998–present)\n\nCurrent touring members:\nAlex Mackay – guitar, bass, keyboards, percussion (2016–present)\nMaria Sappho – keyboards (2024–2025; substitute for Barry Burns)\n\nFormer members:\nBrendan O'Hare – keyboards, guitar (1997)\nJohn Cummings – guitar, programming, bass, drums, keyboards (1995–2015)\n\nOccasional touring musician:\nLuke Sutherland – violin, guitar, vocals, percussion (since 1998)\n\nFormer touring musicians:\nJames Hamilton – drums (2011–2013; substitute for Martin Bulloch)\nScott Paterson – guitar (2015; substitute for John Cummings, 2021; substitute for Alex Mackay)\nCat Myers – drums (2017–2018; substitute for Martin Bulloch)\n\nThe band were originally signed to renowned Glasgow indie label Chemikal Underground, but call a number of labels home, being distributed by different labels such as Matador in the United States and Play it again Sam Records in the United Kingdom. They have also developed their own label called Rock Action Records, named after guitarist Ron Asheton of The Stooges, who had his name changed to Rock Action.\n\nMogwai are named after the creatures from the film Gremlins (the word itself is Cantonese for 'ghost' or 'hunter' dependant on the semi or literal translation), although Braithwaite comments that \"it has no significant meaning and we always intended on getting a better one [name], but like a lot of other things we never got round to it.\".\n\nTheir style has been influenced by such bands as The Cure, Joy Division, The Jesus & Mary Chain, Pixies, My Bloody Valentine, and post-rock granddaddies Slint. During 2004 the band were handed support slots on the tours of two of their heroes, the Pixies and The Cure. It has easily identifiable connections to genres like shoegaze, math rock, art rock, and occasionally instrumental metal. While Mogwai's sound bears little resemblance to punk rock, the band seems to identify closely with the punk ethic.\n\nMogwai's influence on the indie rock scene can be heard in the work of Explosions in the Sky, Italians Giardini di Mirò, Qatsi, and most other contemporary post-rock.\n\nThe fifth Mogwai album, Mr. Beast, was released in March 2006 and returned to the heavier sounds of 1997's Mogwai Young Team.  Mr. Beast saw Mogwai dropping most of their \"post-rock\" crescendoing with songs developing more like rock, with direct hooks and lyrics.\n\nMogwai produced the remix track of 'Plans' on the British group Bloc Party's 2005 album Silent Alarm Remixed.\n\nIn October 2006 Mogwai returned with a soundtrack to the documentary of global football star Zinedine Zidane called Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait,  released through their own label Rock Action. They have also released a soundtrack to Darren Aronofsky's 'The Fountain' in collaboration with Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet.\n\nThe Hawk is Howling was released in September 2008.\n\nIn February 2011 the band released their 7th Studio Album Hardcore Will Never Die, But You Will. And, in July 2013, Mogwai performed their soundtrack to Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait for the first time at a number of dates across the UK. Shortly afterwards, on 5 August, the band revealed via Twitter that they were recording a new studio album at Castle of Doom Studios, released in early 2014 called Rave Tapes.\n\nGuitarist John Cummings left the band in 2015.\n\n2016 saw the band take part in two soundtracks. Atomic was released in April for the documentary 'Atomic, Living in Dread and Promise', and was composed entirely by the band. They also contributed to Before the Flood (Music from the Motion Picture), which featured Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross and Gustavo Santaolalla.\n\nIn 2017, Mogwai released Every Country's Sun, their ninth studio album, which heralded a return to their earlier sound.\n\nMogwai appeared on another film soundtrack in 2018.   Helicon 1, from their 1997 album Ten Rapid, was featured on the original motion picture soundtrack of ‘Beautiful Boy’. \n\nOfficial website:\nhttp:\/\/www.mogwai.co.uk\/ <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Mogwai\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"In an age of hyper-stimulated doom-scrolling and over-polished social media stars, humble Hoboken three piece Phoneboy are all about living in the moment. Singer\/guitarists Wyn Barnum and Ricky Dana met at a tiny technical college lacking much of an indie scene. Pulling in Wyn’s childhood friend, bassist James Fusco, the three college boys bonded over a love of midwest emo. Keyboardist\/Singer Jordan Torres joined the following year. \n\nPhoneboy’s early efforts quickly earned a following on social media. Serving as a de facto street team, fraternity brothers shared the band’s breakout, \"ACID GIRL\" far and wide. Before they knew it these floppy haired crooners had racked up over a million streams across the web. It’s the kind of word-of-mouth buzz that makes you think the internet wasn’t such a bad idea. “There’s definitely a tension there,” says Wyn, speaking to social media. “There’s all this distraction, all this fake fun everybody’s pretending to have, but at the same time the discovery potential is insane.”\n\nComing of age in a global pandemic, the band sure are sharing lots of experiences. Remote learning has offered them plenty of time to work on their sound; flipping through files on yes, their phones, to piece together bits and bobs of riffs and licks. It’s commendable to come off so easy breezy in these uncertain times, but Phoneboy makes it look like no big deal. Their joyous jams and shuffling beats come right on time to get your butt off the couch.\n\nYou wouldn’t call them old souls, but their youthful exuberance is deepened by an already wisened sense of pop-production and alternative song craft. Pairing a 90’s art aesthetic against a fresh clean sound, these phoneboys are ready to bust out beyond TikTok. And with perfectly crafted hip-shaking singalongs like these, maybe we can all take a break from the endless notifications, put our phones done for once, and finally get back out on the floor. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Phoneboy\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Richie Kotzen is an American guitarist, singer, and songwriter. \n\nBorn in Reading, Pennsylvania on February 3, 1970, Richie Kotzen was soon taken by music and first began playing piano at the age of five. At the age of seven he was inspired by New York City band KISS to learn the electric guitar. Relentlessly developing chops and his own unique voice on the guitar, Kotzen was eventually discovered by Shrapnel Records' Mike Varney, and he recorded his first album by the age of 18. During that same year, he also graced the cover of several publications including Guitar World Magazine. He created the video Rock Chops for REH video in 1989, highlighting many of his formative techniques, including using wide-intervals and fluid sweeping.\n\nIn 1993, Kotzen made his big break when he joined the rock band Poison at age 20, co-writing and performing on the album Native Tongue. This album produced two top twenty singles which Richie wrote, Stand and Until You Suffer Some. Kotzen was subsequently fired from the band when it was discovered that he had been romantically involved with Deanna Eve, the ex-fiance of Poison drummer Rikki Rockett. Kotzen and Eve later married and divorced. In 1999 Kotzen replaced Paul Gilbert as guitarist in the mainstream rock band Mr. Big. Kotzen maintained the band's enormous success, performing on the Mr. Big record Get Over It, which sold more than 1,975,000 copies in its first two weeks in Japan, eventually reaching platinum status. Kotzen also contributed guitars to Mr. Big's subsequent release Actual Size. The record included the Kotzen song Shine, which debuted at number one on Japanese radio charts. Following the disbanding of Mr. Big, Kotzen released the solo album Change, in 2003. The title track, and the song Get A Life were featured in TV commercials throughout Japan.\n\nIn mid 2002 Kotzen established a recording Studio\/Production company in Los Angeles, California. He has since been producing acclaimed solo albums and collaborating with various figures in rock, jazz, and fusion. He now has formed a band called Forty Deuce which recently released a new album entitled Nothing to Lose.\n\n\nRichie has a unique style, which he has described as a mix of rock, jazz fusion, and soul music. Of his albums, he claims he is most proud of Vertu. Kotzen utilizes a heavy amount of legato playing into his solos.\n\nRichie is now living in Los Angeles, California. Besides playing the guitar, his hobbies include exercise and sports, especially basketball. Richie has said that if he had'nt become a professional musician, he would have liked to play professional basketball.\n\nIn 2008, Kotzen released his first official live album, \"Live In São Paulo\", which featured Johnny Griparic on bass and  Dan Potruch on Drums. \n\nDiscography\n\n    * (1989) Richie Kotzen\n    * (1990) Fever Dream\n    * (1991) Electric Joy\n    * (1991) Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey (Soundtrack)\n    * (1993) Native Tongue (Poison)\n    * (1994) Mother Head's Family Reunion\n    * (1995) Inner Galactic Fusion Experience\n    * (1995) Tilt (with Greg Howe)\n    * (1996) Wave of Emotion\n    * (1996) Times Gonna Tell (EP)\n    * (1997) Kotzen\/Howe Project (with Greg Howe)\n    * (1997) Something to Say\n    * (1998) What Is\n    * (1999) Break It All Down\n    * (1999) BiPolar Blues\n    * (1999) Vertu (project with Stanley Clarke and Lenny White)\n    * (1999) Get Over It (Mr. Big)\n    * (2000) Deep Cuts (Mr. Big)\n    * (2001) Actual Size (Mr. Big)\n    * (2001) Slow\n    * (2002) In Japan (Mr. Big)\n    * (2003) Change\n    * (2003) Acoustic Cuts\n    * (2004) Get Up\n    * (2004) The Best of Richie Kotzen\n    * (2005) Nothing to Lose (Forty-Deuce)\n    * (2006) ZxR Ai Senshi\n    * (2006) Into the Black\n    * (2007) ''Return Of The Mother Head's Family Reunion'' (Japan & Europe)\n    * (2007) ''Go Faster'' (US only)\n    * (2008) ''Live In São Paulo''\n    * (2009) ''Peace Sign''\n    * (2011) ''24 Hours''\n    * (2013) ''The Winery Dogs'' (The Winery Dogs)\n    * (2014) ''Unleashed In Japan: The Second Show'' (The Winery Dogs) Released only In Japan (DVD\/2CD)\n    * (2014) ''The Essential''\n    * (2015) ''Cannibals''\n    * (2015) ''Hot Streak'' (The Winery Dogs)\n    * (2017) ''Salting Earth''\n\nVideography\n\n    * (1989) Rock Chops\n    * (1994) Mother Head's family Reunion (Videoclip from the Mother Head's family Reunion Album)\n    * (1996) Wave of Emotion (Videoclip from the Wave of Emotion Album)\n    * (2001) Don't Wanna Lie (Videoclip from the Slow Album)\n    * (2001) Shine (Videoclip from Mr. Big's Actual Size Album)\n    * (2002) ''Hi-Tech  Rock Guitar''\n    * (2005) ''Live In South America''\n    * (2008) ''Chase It'' (Videoclip from the R.O.T.M.F.R.

        "biografia":"Dropkick Murphys are a punk rock band formed in Quincy, Massachusetts, United States in 1996. First playing together in the basement of a friend's barbershop, the band made a name for itself because of its relentless touring and for its annual St. Patrick's Day weekend shows in Boston. The band's songs often deal with Celtic influences, and the working-class environment in which the band members grew up.\n\nThe band put out a series of EPs and was signed by Rancid frontman Tim Armstrong's label Hellcat Records.  In 1998, the Dropkick Murphys released their first full-length album, Do Or Die.  Lead singer Mike McColgan, who left the band later that year, was replaced by The Bruisers lead singer Al Barr.  In 1999, they released their followup album, The Gang's All Here.  In 2001, they released their third album, Sing Loud, Sing Proud.  The album showcased the group’s developing sound and included collaborations with The Pogues' frontman Shane MacGowan and Cock Sparrer's Colin McFaull.  It also marked a significant lineup change for the band.  Original guitarist Rick Barton was replaced by former The Ducky Boys' guitarists James Lynch and Marc Orrell; instruments were added and played by new members Ryan Foltz and Spicy McHaggis.\n\nThe Dropkick Murphys' next album, Blackout, was released in 2003.  The new album included the radio hit \"Walk Away,\" as well as the songs \"Fields of Athenry\" and \"The Dirty Glass.\"  The latter features female vocals by Stephanie Dougherty (Deadly Sins).  Around the same time, the band released a re-working of the Boston Red Sox anthem \"Tessie,\" which then became the official song of the team's 2004 World Series run.  \"Tessie\" was also used throughout the major motion picture Fever Pitch and was included on the EA Sports MVP Baseball 2005 soundtrack.  In 2005, the Dropkick Murphys released Singles Collection Volume 2, featuring covers, B-sides, and other material that didn't make it onto previous albums, and the band contributed a recording of \"We Got the Power\" to Rock Against Bush, Volume 2.\n\nThe Dropkick Murphys' fifth studio album, The Warrior's Code, was released on June 21, 2005.  It features the singles \"Sunshine Highway,\" \"The Walking Dead,\" \"The Warrior's Code,\" as well as the bonus track \"Tessie.\"  It also includes a song that was inspired by a Woody Guthrie poem, which the group named \"I'm Shipping Up to Boston.\" The song was featured in Martin Scorsese's 2006 film The Departed.  Scorsese mentioned the band in an interview after winning his first Oscar.\n\nThe Dropkick Murphys released their sixth studio album, The Meanest of Times, on September 18, 2007.  It was their first release not on the Hellcat Records label but instead on the label Born & Bred.\n\nIn early 2008, Marc Orrell left the band.  Thereupon Tim Brennan, who had been playing mandolin, accordion, banjo, tin whistle, and guitar for the band since 2004, replaced Orrell on lead guitar.  Tim's previous musical duties were taken over by Jeff DaRosa, former member of The Vigilante and Pinkerton Thugs.\n\nIn September of 2022,  This Machine Still Kills Fascists was released.  It's an acoustic album with unused words and lyrics written by Woody Guthrie, selected and given to the band to use by Guthrie's daughter Nora.  It did not feature Al Barr, who was on hiatus for family matters.\n\nThe band will release their twelfth album, Okemah Rising, on May 12, 2023. The album was recorded during the same sessions for This Machine Still Kills Facists and like that album will feature songs using the unused lyrics by Woody Guthrie. The album was preceded by the singles \"I Know How it Feels\" on March 1, 2023, and \"Gotta Get to Peekskill\" (featuring Violent Femmes) on March 30, 2023.\n\nStudio albums\nDo or Die (1998)\nThe Gang's All Here (1999)\nSing Loud, Sing Proud!

After supporting the likes of Nothing But Thieves and Razorlight on a string of tours, Airways’ “Starting To Spin” EP began cropping up all over Spotify playlists and has generated over 7 million streams to date. Fans emerged all over the world, and the band was amazed to find the demand was strong enough to fill clubs throughout Europe.\n\n“It’s so weird to see a room full of German or Belgian kids singing all the words to our stuff,” says Daniels. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Airways\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"There are two bands named Nunatak. 1. A band from Antartica known for performing for Live Earth in 2007 2. A Spanish indie folk band with pop elements.\n\n1. Nunatak is the British Antarctic Survey’s Rothera Research Station’s house band. The five person indie rock band is part of a science team investigating climate change and evolutional biology on the Antarctic Peninsula – a region where temperatures have risen by nearly 3°C during the last 50 years.\n\nFrom April to October - the Antarctic winter - planes can’t fly in because of the cold – the frozen sea keeps ships out. Physically isolated from the rest of the world, the 22 wintering team share their talent and creativity with one another.\n\nThe group gained worldwide attention after being the sole act of the Antarctic concert for Live Earth on July 7, 2007. Several people - including Dave Holmes and Larry King - called their performance the best of the concerts.\n\nNunatak\n(a Greenlandic word): An exposed summit of a  ridge mountain or peak (not covered with snow) within an ice field or glacier. \n\n2. (Translated from the Spanish version of this page, written in 2014.) The light melodies typical of folk and pop intermingle, creating a precious mosaic with epic overtones of voices and acoustic sounds. This is how Nunatak, a group from Cartagena formed by Adri (Ukelele, Guitar and Vocals), Dumdaca (Drums, Percussion), Gonzalo (Guitar and Vocals), Nando (Bass and Voices), Arnelio (Drums, Percussion), Viwe (Keyboards) are the main band. ) Erin (Violin and Voices) and Jose Manuel (Trumpet) are supporting members.\nIn September 2012 Nunatak became known as part of the Lemon Pop festival poster, presenting the themes of his first self-released EP. Nunatak is nature, it is wind, it is fire, it is a mosaic of melodies and voices, sometimes epic, sometimes precious, that merge into a powerful choral staging, that invites you to smile and pushes you to scream. The band has received a very good reception from the public and specialized media (Capitán Demo, El Mundo de Tulsa, Muzicalia). Currently Nunatak continues to perform their first EP on stage as well as other new songs that will become part of his future work. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Nunatak\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Joost Klein (born 10 November 10 1997 in Leeuwarden, The Netherlands) is a Dutch rapper and electro \/ gabber musician. He has released music as Joost, but also under his full name, Joost Klein. His 'secret' musical alter egos include jailbreak iphone now, internetcafe 247 and ipadkid2001.\n\nJoost did not have an easy start in life. At just twelve years old, he lost his father to cancer. Less than a year later, his mother passed away from cardiac arrest. Orphaned at a young age, Joost turned to the internet and launched a YouTube channel called EenhoornJoost.\n\nLabeling Joost is no simple task. His videos are surreal, unpredictable, and often absurd. A far cry from the typical family-friendly vloggers. His sketches frequently lean into humor; one example shows him drunkenly celebrating his birthday with friends. But there’s more beneath the surface. He also made a documentary in which he returns to Friesland, the province he grew up in, and speaks candidly about losing both his parents as a child.\n\nJoost didn’t limit himself to YouTube. He soon began making music, starting with a few tracks on YouTube and SoundCloud. This led to the release of his debut EP Dakloos, featuring popular songs like 'Dakloos' and 'Zelfgemaakt'. A year later, his mixtape Scandinavian Boy marked his breakthrough, with the title track becoming his biggest hit.\n\nHis rise in the music scene was also influenced by fellow artist Donnie. The duo first collaborated on the track 'René Froger' and later joined forces on the album M Van Marketing. Songs like 'Parmezaan & Linkerbaan' became fan favorites.\n\nSix months later, Joost released his first full album: Albino. This project included earlier releases such as 'Ome Robert' and 'Meeuw', along with a collection of new tracks. The title song 'Albino' became the standout hit, followed closely by 'Joost Klein' and 'Bus Gemist' (featuring Mick Spek).\n\nOver the following years, Joost continued to release new projects, including 1983 (named after his brother's birth year), Joost Klein 7, Albino Sports, Vol. 1 (with Brunzyn) and Fryslân.\n\nIn 2023, it was announced that Joost would represent the Netherlands at the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 in Malmö. After successfully reaching the finals, he was disqualified due to a backstage incident where he allegedly made a \"threatening movement\" towards a camerawoman, violating the contest's rules for a safe working environment.\n\nFollowing Eurovision, Joost released a string of singles — 'Luchtballon', 'The Bird Song', 'TRAFIK!' (featuring Käärijä), 'Filthy Dog' and 'Why Not???'. Several of these tracks appear on his latest album Unity, released in February 2025. The album features collaborations such as 'United By Music' (with Tommy Cash), '1' (with Scooter), and 'Gabberland', as well as his viral 2023 hit 'Friesenjung'.\n\nAfter the album he released various tracks and EPs under the names jailbreak iphone now, internetcafe 247 and ipadkid2001. He also created Instagram profiles for these pseudonyms.\n\nOn New Year's Day 2026 he released the album Kleinkunst, which features artists like horsegiirL, Vieze Asbak, Mark Forsterand his alter egos jailbreak iphone now and internetcafe247. He also announced a world tour for summer 2026 including two shows at Ziggo Dome in Amsterdam and a gig at the Coachella Festival. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Joost\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Kiss (often stylized as KIϟϟ) was an American rock band formed in New York City in January 1973 by Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons, Ace Frehley, and Peter Criss. Well known for its members' face paint and stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid–late 1970s with its shocking live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood-spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits, and pyrotechnics. The band has gone through several lineup changes, with Stanley and Simmons being the only members to feature in every lineup. The original and best-known lineup consists of Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Simmons (vocals and bass), Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Criss (drums and vocals).\n\nWith their make-up and costumes, the band members took on the personae of comic book-style characters: the Starchild (Stanley), the Demon (Simmons), the Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and the Catman (Criss). Due to creative differences, both Criss and Frehley had departed the group by 1982.\n\nIn 1983, Kiss began performing without makeup and costumes, thus marking the beginning of the band's \"unmasked\" era that would last for over a decade. The band experienced a commercial resurgence during this era, with the Platinum-certified album Lick It Up successfully introducing them to a new generation of fans, and its music videos received regular airplay on MTV. Eric Carr, who had replaced Criss in 1980, died in 1991 of heart cancer and was replaced by Eric Singer. In response to a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the mid-1990s, the original lineup re-united in 1996, which also saw the return of its makeup and stage costumes. The resulting reunion tour was highly successful, grossing $143.7 million, making it the band's most successful tour to date. Criss and Frehley subsequently left the band again, and have been replaced by Singer and Tommy Thayer. The band has continued with its original stage makeup, with Singer and Thayer using the original Catman and Spaceman makeup, respectively. In September 2018, Kiss announced that, after 45 years of recording and performing, it would be embarking on its ongoing final tour, the End of the Road World Tour, which started in January 2019 and concluded in December 2023.\n\nKiss is regarded as one of the most influential rock bands of all time, as well as one of the best-selling bands of all time, having sold more than 75 million records worldwide, including 21 million RIAA-certified albums. Kiss also holds the title as America's No. 1 Gold record award-winning group of all time, having earned 30 Gold albums. Kiss has 14 Platinum albums, with three albums being multi-Platinum. On April 10, 2014, the four original members of Kiss were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Kiss was ranked by MTV as the ninth \"Greatest Metal Band of All Time\", and placed tenth on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" list, as well as being ranked as the third \"Best Metal and Hard Rock Live Band of All Time\" by Loudwire magazine.\n\nStudio albums\nKiss (1974)\nHotter than Hell (1974)\nDressed to Kill (1975)\nDestroyer (1976)\nRock and Roll Over (1976)\nLove Gun (1977)\nDynasty (1979)\nUnmasked (1980)\nMusic from \"The Elder\" (1981)\nCreatures of the Night (1982)\nLick It Up (1983)\nAnimalize (1984)\nAsylum (1985)\nCrazy Nights (1987)\nHot in the Shade (1989)\nRevenge (1992)\nCarnival of Souls: The Final Sessions (1997)\nPsycho Circus (1998)\nSonic Boom (2009)\nMonster (2012) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kiss\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

After hanging around on a night out with friends, Otis showed Royel some of the demos he had been working on. Royel took them home and started matching with guitars and some Fat Boy Slim samples he stole during his time in NYC.\n\nThe two started having weekly catch upsand churning out tunes in Roy’s Bondi Beach sunroom, laying guitars over beats and going on long drives along the east coast to write melodies over the tracks. Drawing inspiration from old Japanese city pop records and ‘90s nostalgia and produced by Julian Sudek, the guys sent their track off to the legendary mixer Dave Fridmann who agreed to mix their debut song. Without You is the duo’s shimmering debut single. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Royel+Otis\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Bad Omens is an American metal band formed in 2015 in Richmond, Virginia by vocalist and producer Noah Sebastian, (then) guitarist Nicholas Ruffilo and bassist Vincent Riquier.\n\nThe current lineup of the band includes: Noah Sebastian (lead vocals, programming), Nicholas Ruffilo (bass, backing vocals), Joakim Karlsson (lead guitar, programming, backing vocals and rhythm guitar) and Nick Folio (drums and percussions).\n\nHistory\nThe first idea to form the band came in 2013 when Noah Sebastian, then guitarist of a Washington D.C.-based band named Immoralist, began writing lyrics. Therefore in 2014 he departed the band and in the subsequent year he contacted his old friend Nicholas Ruffilo to start his new project, later involving bassist Vincent Riquier, who introduced him to another friend, Joakim \"Jolly\" Karlsson. The band put out an untitled demo EP containing rough versions of their debut album tracks, which caught the eye of Sumerian Records. The EP was good enough for Sumerian to recommend taking most of the tracks and putting them on a full-length.\n\nThe first name adopted by the band was \"CHLDRN\", and \"Bad Omens\" was originally supposed to be the title of one of their early songs. Ash Avildsen, founder of Sumerian Records, suggested the band to change the name to Bad Omens and so they picked another name for the song, which became the hit  Glass Houses. \n\nThe band realeased its first self-titled EP Bad Omens on August 19, 2016 with Sumerian Records.\n\nBad Omens' rising fame got them a spot on Warped Tour in 2017, which gave them notice from pop punk fans and metal fans alike. The same year, Noah Sebastian worked with American deathcore act, Winds of Plague on their fifth studio album Blood of My Enemy. The band embarked on what is seemingly their largest tour yet, supporting Parkway Drive on their Reverence Tour along with Stick to Your Guns in the spring of 2018. After the tour, the band took time off to finish writing their sophomore album and bassist Vincent Riquier left the quartet in July 2018.\n\nTheir second full-length album, Finding God Before God Finds Me (FGBGFM), was released in 2019, having a deluxe edition released in 2020, with the addition of the songs Limits and Never Know, which both charted on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs, and a cover of the 90's hit Come Undone, from Duran Duran.\n\nThe band embarked on their first full US headlining tour in 2020, with support from Oh, Sleeper, Thousand Below and Bloodline, but on March 13, the remainder of the tour was indefinitely postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn 2022, after filling in the spot of Every Time I Die on the Voyeurist Tour with headliner Underoath, Bad Omens toured with A Day to Remember, The Ghost Inside, and Beartooth. The band later announced on August 23 that they would be headlining a North American tour with Dayseeker, Make Them Suffer, and Thousand Below. \n\nThat same year they released their most known album, The Death of Peace of Mind which took them to charts and highlighted them in social media. The album, which Noah describes as the most experimental and faithful to who they want to be as a band, made great numbers and the songs Just Pretend and The Death of Peace of Mind became Gold Certified by RIAA in USA.\n\nDuring 2023, the band toured the \"Concrete Forever US Tour\" supported by ERRA and I See Stars (which were making a comeback after +5 years away from the scene). Later the band announced dates for the \"Concrete Forever 2024\" in US and EU and were announced as guests for the Bring Me The Horizon's \"Nx_Gn Wrld Tour\", with Cassyette and Static Dress.\n\nAlthough the band members remain low profile, the band keeps a solid fanbase, and according to the frontman, Noah Sebastian, they've been working on the sequel of The Death of Peace of Mind.\n\nAfter the tour with BMTH ended and three days away from the beginning of the \"Concrete Forever Europe\" tour, Bad Omens released the single V.A.N featuring Poppy, who was going to support the band for the CF\/EU tour then.\n\nIn 2024, Bad Omens got back touring and released some studio images, showing something was about to come off. On April, 16th the band announced the releasing of two songs: \"THE DRAIN\" - a collaboration with HEALTH and SWARM - and \"THE DEATH OF PEACE OF MIND (SO WYLIE PATCH)\". \n\nOn the same day, the band announced the releasing of what appeared to be a new album called \"CONCRETE JUNGLE (THE OST)\", fueled by collabs with ERRA, iRis.EXE, WE ARE FURY, Poppy (on V.A.N) and others, with new songs, live tracks and revisited versions of TDOPOM songs, with Wargasm and A Thousand Below appearing on new versions of ARTIFICIAL SUICIDE, The Grey and the band's oldschool song \"Hedonist\" (now, \"Hedonist (recharged)\"). CONCRETE JUNGLE (THE OST) has been published on May 31, 2024.\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\nBad Omens (2016)Finding God Before God Finds Me (2019)The Death of Peace of Mind (2022)\n\nSoundtracks\nCONCRETE JUNGLE (THE OST) (2024) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Bad+Omens\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Regarded as one of the revolutionaries in jazz music and is considered one of the greatest saxophone players in modern jazz history. He led many others to follow in his footsteps.\n\nWashington's history was music-filled. His mother was a church chorister, and his father was a collector of old jazz 78s and a saxophonist as well, so music was everywhere in the home. He grew up with the great jazz men and big band leaders like Benny Goodman, Fletcher Henderson, and others like them. At the age of 8, with the desire for him to be more than he could be, Grover Sr. gave Jr. a saxophone. He practiced and sneaked into clubs to see famous Buffalo blues musicians.\n\nHe left Buffalo and played with a mid-west group called the Four Clefs. He was drafted into the US Army shortly thereafter, but this was to be to his advantage, as he met drummer Billy Cobham. Cobham, a mainstay in New York City, introduced Washington to many New York musicians. After leaving the Army, Washington freelanced his talents around New York City, eventually landing in Philadelphia in 1967.\n\nGrover's big break came at the expense of another artist. Alto sax man Hank Crawford was unable to make a recording date with Prestige Records, and Washington took his place, even though he was a backup. This led to his first album, Inner City Blues. He was talented, and displayed heart and soul with soprano, alto, tenor, and baritone saxophones. Refreshing for his time, he made headway into the jazz mainstream. His fifth album, 1974's Mister Magic was a commercial success, and introduced guitarist Eric Gale in as a near-permanent member in Washington's arsenal.\n\nA string of acclaimed records brought Washington through the 1970s, which culminated in the signature piece for everything Washington would do from then on. 1980's Winelight was the album that defined everything Washington was about. The album was smooth, fused with R and B and easy listening feel. Washington's love of basketball, especially the Philadelphia 76ers, led him to dedicate his first track, Let It Flow to Julius Erving (Dr. J). The highlight of the album, and a main staple of radio airplay everywhere, was his great collaboration with soul artist Bill Withers, Just The Two of Us. It was also the final step away from Motown, landing him on Elektra Records and into a new era of jazz excellence. The album went platinum in 1981, and also won Grammy Awards in 1982 for Best R and B Song (\"Just The Two of Us\"), and Best Jazz Fusion Performance (\"Winelight\"). \"Winelight\" was also nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year.\n\nFrom that point, Washington is credited (or scorned, as some may say) for giving rise to a new batch of talent that would make its mark in the late 80s and early 90s. He is blamed for bringing Kenny G to the forefront, but also credited with bringing such smooth jazz artists as Walter Beasley, Steve Cole, Pamela Williams, Najee, George Howard, and The Philadelphia Experiment into popular attention.\n\nThe tragedy and irony of Washington's life was that while he was able to get his big break from another artist's absence, Washington lived long enough to bring smooth jazz to the last points of the old millennium, but didn't outlive Hank Crawford, whose absence gave him his big break (and is still alive, as of 2005). On December 17th, 1999, while waiting in the green room after taping four songs for the The Early Show, at CBS Studios in New York City, Washington collapsed. He was taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at about 7:30 p.m. His doctors determined that he had suffered a massive heart attack.\n\nGrover Washington Jr.'s legacy lives on in the futures of up-and-coming jazz artists, and his life is celebrated from college campuses all around the nation to the hallowed streets of his own Philadelphia, his adopted hometown. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Grover+Washington,+Jr.\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Red Hot Chili Peppers is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1982, consisting of Anthony Kiedis (vocals), Flea (bass), John Frusciante (guitar), and Chad Smith (drums). Their music blends elements of alternative rock, funk, punk rock, hard rock, hip hop, and psychedelic rock, and they have influenced genres such as funk metal, rap metal, rap rock, and nu metal. With over 120 million records sold worldwide, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are among the best-selling bands in history. They hold records for the most number-one singles on the US Billboard Alternative Songs chart (15), the most cumulative weeks at number one (91), and the most top-ten songs (28). The band has won three Grammy Awards, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2022.\n\nThe band was founded by Kiedis, Flea, guitarist Hillel Slovak, and drummer Jack Irons. Due to other commitments, Slovak and Irons did not appear on their self-titled debut album \"The Red Hot Chili Peppers\" (1984), which instead featured guitarist Jack Sherman and drummer Cliff Martinez. Slovak returned for the second album, \"Freaky Styley\" (1985), and Irons rejoined for the third, \"The Uplift Mofo Party Plan\" (1987). Irons left the band following Slovak’s death from a drug overdose in 1988.\n\nWith Frusciante and Smith joining shortly after, the Red Hot Chili Peppers released \"Mother’s Milk\" (1989) and their first major commercial success, \"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\" (1991). Frusciante left the group during their 1992 tour, struggling with the band’s sudden fame. After working with several guitarists, the band recruited Dave Navarro, who played on \"One Hot Minute\" (1995). The album did not replicate the success of its predecessor, and both Frusciante and Kiedis faced issues with drug addiction during the decade.\n\nFrusciante rejoined the group in 1998, and their seventh album, \"Californication\" (1999), became their most commercially successful, selling over 16 million copies worldwide. The follow-up albums \"By the Way\" (2002) and \"Stadium Arcadium\" (2006) were also highly successful, with \"Stadium Arcadium\" reaching number one on the Billboard 200. Frusciante left again in 2009 to pursue a solo career and was replaced by Josh Klinghoffer, who performed on \"I’m with You\" (2011) and \"The Getaway\" (2016). Frusciante rejoined in 2019, and in 2022 the band released their twelfth and thirteenth studio albums, \"Unlimited Love\" and \"Return of the Dream Canteen.\"\n\nStudio albums\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers (1984)\nFreaky Styley (1985)\nThe Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987)\nMother's Milk (1989)\nBlood Sugar Sex Magik (1991)\nOne Hot Minute (1995)\nCalifornication (1999)\nBy the Way (2002)\nStadium Arcadium (2006)\nI'm with You (2011)\nThe Getaway (2016)\nUnlimited Love (2022)\nReturn of the Dream Canteen (2022) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"The Surfaris were an American surf rock band formed in Glendora, California in 1962. They are best known for two songs that hit the national charts in May 1963, which were \"Surfer Joe\" and \"Wipe Out\" (respectively on the A side and B side of a 45 RPM single). The original band members were Ron Wilson (drums), Jim Fuller (lead guitar), Bob Berryhill (rhythm guitar), and Pat Connolly (bass). Saxophone player Jim Pash joined after their initial recording.\n\nRon Wilson's energetic drum solo helped make \"Wipe Out\" the one of the best-remembered instrumental song of the period. \"Wipe Out\" is also remembered particularly for its introduction before the music starts, a cracking sound (imitating a breaking surf board), and a manic voice babbling \"ha ha ha ha ha wipe out\". A \"wipe out\" is a misfortune that can occur in surfing, that is, the surfer falling off the board with physical danger, and\/or interrupting the ride prematurely. The song is generally regarded as being the surfing anthem.\n\nThe band released a series of records, with only one other single, \"Point Panic\", having any impact on the charts. Point Panic is a renowned surfing venue in Hawaii.\n\nThe Surfaris disbanded in 1966 but have periodically reunited and are still active as of 2004, performing and recording, often re-recording their old songs.\n\nDrummer Ron Wilson died on May 7, 1989, one month short of his 45th birthday. Wilson had released an album of his songs, entitled \"Lost It In The Surf\", on Bennet House Records of Grass Valley, California, recorded in June 1987. A very small number of cassettes of this album were produced. \"Lost It In The Surf\" included a cover of \"Louie, Louie\" with Scottish bagpipes.\n\nForssi died from a brain tumor in 1998, and Pash died from heart failure in 2005.\n\nBob Berryhill currently performs worldwide under the Surfaris banner as \"Bob Berryhill's Surfaris.\" \nThe Surfaris with Bob Berryhill in 2015 released a critically acclaimed album entitled \"The Surfaris Hurley Sessions.\". See discography below.\n\nJim Fuller played with his own band, \"Jim Fuller and the Beatnik\", and died on 3 March 2017 in Monrovia, California at age 69. Connolly has since left the music business.\n\n\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Surfaris\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Mick Gordon (born 9 July 1985) is an Australian composer and sound designer whose compositions aim to transcend the perceptual boundary between music and its context.  Mick’s work considers the role of music as a translation of the world in which it exists rather than a simple accompaniment.  Through creativity, interpretation and collaboration he develops a meaningful exchange between the visual world and music culminating in the authorship of a unified original work of art.\n\nMick utilises a broad range of modern musical sound design and traditional composition techniques in order to be unconstrained by any singular genre.  His music is inspired by the connection between the audience and the experience and seeks to overcome the separation between music and the world in which it exists.\n\nRecently, Mick scored the video game DOOM - the return of id Software’s seminal first-person shooter.  To illustrate the game’s portrayal of Hell and its insidious power he explored the role of energy in sound production and how the physical properties of analogue equipment can be imparted onto digital sources.\n\nHis award-winning interactive score for Microsoft’s reboot of KILLER INSTINCT featured a myriad of performers from around the globe.  Mick collaborated with a viking choir in Sweden, representatives of the Nez Perce tribe in Idaho and numerous other performers, vocalists, lyricists and translators to produce its Amazon best-selling soundtrack.\n\nMick’s score for the video game, WOLFENSTEIN: THE NEW ORDER interweaves modern musical sound design techniques with 1960s style record production.  He synthesised field recordings and transformed them into new physically playable instruments to create unique musical palettes.  The score explores the role of distortion as a modern musical device.  The process of overdriving various pieces of analogue equipment into extremes to create tension was used to represent the game’s chaotic villain, Deathshead.  Additionally, to musically represent the rebellious plight of the heroes against their oppressors, Mick utilised vintage instruments, microphones and recording equipment to create music inspired by protest and freedom movement songs of the 1960s.\n\nMick Gordon is represented by the Gorfaine Schwartz agency.\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Mick+Gordon\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Arctic Monkeys are an alternative rock band formed in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England in 2002 after meeting at Stocksbridge High School. The band consists of Alex Turner (vocals, guitar, piano), Jamie Cook (guitar), Nick O'Malley (backing vocals, bass) and Matt Helders (drums, vocals). Founding bassist Andy Nicholson left in 2006.\n\nThey are one of the first bands to come to public attention via the Internet via MySpace, despite none of them having an account. Their rise to success started in late 2004\/early 2005 when demo songs that had been handed out in CD form at gigs found their way onto the internet. These demos rapidly spread among message boards and friends leading to a growing fan base for the band, and were collected on the unofficial Beneath the Boardwalk, which the band recognizes on their website.  The band owe much of their success to viral buzz via the Internet, and have eschewed typical 'commercial' channels, including refusing to appear on the UK's (now discontinued) Top Of The Pops music program, which was often seen as a gateway to success.\n\nThe band's debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, held the record for the largest first week sales of a debut album in the UK (in its first week, it sold more than the rest of the Top 20 albums combined). The album sold over 360,000 copies in its first week, but lost the title in November 2007 to Leona Lewis's album Spirit.. It also won the 2006 Mercury Prize, was chosen as the best album of year 2006 by Q Magazine, and received a slew of other accolades.\n\nOn 19th June 2006 the band officially announced that founding member and bassist Andy Nicholson had left the band after missing the American leg of their tour due to 'fatigue' and the other band members couldn't stand the constant 'missing his girlfriend syndrome' so they told him to sling his hook. Former Dodgems bassist Nick O'Malley was initially brought in as a stand-in, and played the band's remaining summer commitments. He was then announced as Nicholson's permanent replacement. \n\nThe band's second album, Favourite Worst Nightmare, was released on 23 April 2007, a week after the release of accompanying single \"Brianstorm\"\". Like the first album, this one quickly reached No. 1 in the album charts. Alex Turner described the songs as \"very different from last time\", adding that the sound of some tracks are \"a bit full-on\". A secret gig played at Sheffield's Leadmill on 10 February 2007, debuted seven new songs (six from Favourite Worst Nightmare and one other). Early reviews of the release were positive and described it as \"very, very fast and very, very loud\".\n\nThe band recorded half of the third album, Humbug at Rancho De La Luna recording sessions with Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age in early autumn, 2008, and half in the New York sessions with James Ellis Ford, their producer, in spring, 2009, following their January tour of New Zealand and Australia. During this tour, lead single \"Crying Lightning\", along with Humbug songs \"Pretty Visitors\", \"Dangerous Animals\" and \"Potion Approaching\" (then known as \"Go-Kart\"), was debuted live. It was later revealed by Matt Helders in a video diary that the album would consist of 14 tracks and that Turner would stay in New York to oversee the mixing of the material. However, the final track listing, revealed on 1 June 2009, listed only 10.\n\nNME reported in May 2011 that the band were teaming up with producer James Ellis Ford once again and would be releasing their fourth studio album, Suck It And See, in late spring at the earliest. Q magazine reported that the fourth Arctic Monkeys album would be of a \"more accessible vintage\" than Humbug. Q printed edition 299 states \"It's the sound of a band drawing back the curtains and letting the sunshine in\". The album was recorded in Sound City Studios in Los Angeles in 2010 and 2011. On 4 March 2011, the band premiered on its website a new track called \"Brick By Brick\" with lead vocals by Matt Helders. Helders explained that this is not a single, just a tease of what is coming and that is it is going to be on the fourth album. On 10 March 2011 the band revealed the album name and was released on 6 June 2011. The album's first single, titled \"Don't Sit Down 'Cause I've Moved Your Chair\" was released as a digital download on 12 April and on vinyl with \"\"Brick By Brick\" on 16 April for Record Store Day.\n\nOn 27 February 2012, the band released a new song titled \"R U Mine\" on their YouTube channel, serving as the bands lead single for their fifth studio album AM, despite it was originally going to be a stand alone single. AM has received critical acclaim from music critics, upon the release of AM on 9 September 2013, the album debuted at number 1 in the UK album charts, selling over 157,000 copies in its first week. The album received widespread critical acclaim and brought Arctic Monkeys their third nomination for the Mercury Prize. The album also won the Brit award for Best British Album. In the United States, the album sold 42,000 copies in its first week and debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 chart, becoming the band's highest-charting album in the United States.\n\nIn December 2016, Turner confirmed to BBC Radio Sheffield that the band's hiatus had ended and work had begun on their sixth studio album. The album had begun recording in September 2017.The album, Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino was released on 11 May 2018. It's their first concept album, about being a hotel on the moon. Following its release, the album was promoted by the singles \"Four Out Of Five\" and \"Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino\". This album had a massive change in sound compared to their first five albums, being slower and more piano based.\n\nOn 8 December 2021, the band was announced as the Saturday co-headliner of the 2022 Reading and Leeds Festival. On 23 August 2022 at the Zurich Openair festival, they debuted new song \"I Ain't Quite Where I Think I Am\" The following day they announced their seventh studio album,  The Car, which was released on 21 October 2022. On 30 August 2022, they released the first single from the album, \"There'd Better Be A Mirrorball\", accompanied by a video directed by Turner. The Car peaked at No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart, behind Midnights by Taylor Swift, being their first ever album to not debut at No.1 in the UK. In the US, the album landed at No. 6 on the Billboard 200.\n\nLead singer\/songwriter Alex Turner started a two-man project with the former singer\/guitarist from the Rascals and guitarist of The Little Flames, Miles Kane. The band is called 'The Last Shadow Puppets'.\n\nStudio albums\nWhatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006)\nFavourite Worst Nightmare (2007)\nHumbug (2009)\nSuck It And See (2011)\nAM (2013)\nTranquility Base Hotel & Casino (2018)\nThe Car (2022)\n\nhttp:\/\/www.arcticmonkeys.com\/ <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Arctic+Monkeys\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"There are at least four artists with the name Placebo:\n\n1) Placebo are a British alternative rock duo formed in London in 1994 by vocalist-guitarist Brian Molko and bassist-guitarist Stefan Olsdal. Drummer Robert Schultzberg joined in late 1994 but left in 1996 shortly after the release of the band's eponymous debut album due to conflicts with Molko. He was replaced the same year by Steve Hewitt. Molko was born in Belgium, and Olsdal and Schultzberg were born in Sweden. Remaining members Molko and Olsdal both grew up in Luxembourg before separately relocating to London and are both British citizens.\n\nFollowing the release of a demo, a split single, and their eponymous debut album, Placebo gained exposure in 1997 after the single \"Nancy Boy\" became popular in the UK, a song notorious at the time for its gender-bending content. The band stood out among the Britpop scene they were associated with at the time for their androgynous appearance and musical content, as well as Molko's distinctive voice and lyrics that openly discussed sexuality, mental health, and drug use.\n\nHewitt left Placebo in 2007 due to personal and musical differences. He was replaced the following year by Steve Forrest. Placebo released two albums with Forrest, who left in 2015 to pursue his own musical career. Since 2015, Placebo have been officially a duo, though augmented with additional musicians.\n\nPlacebo have collaborated with various artists over the years, including David Bowie, Justin Warfield, Michael Stipe, and Alison Mosshart. To date, Placebo have released eight studio albums, all of which have reached the Top 20 in the United Kingdom, and have sold around 14 million records worldwide.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Placebo_(band)\n\nDiscography\nPlacebo (1996)\nWithout You I'm Nothing (1998)\nBlack Market Music (2000)\nSleeping with Ghosts (2003)\nMeds (2006)\nBattle for the Sun (2009)\nLoud Like Love (2013)\nNever Let Me Go (2022)\n\n----------\n\n2) Placebo is a Jazz Rock\/Jazz fusion band from Belgium who released three LPs in the early '70s.

        "biografia":"Sigur Rós is an Icelandic post-rock band. The name is derived from the name of lead vocalist Jónsi Birgisson's little sister, Sigurrós. They hail from the same creative and vibrant Icelandic music scene as múm and Amiina. They released their first-ever foray into film-making with their tour documentary, Heima in late 2007. \n\nJón Þór Birgisson (Jónsi), Georg Hólm, and Ágúst Ævar Gunnarsson formed the group in Reykjavík, Iceland in August 1994. They soon won a record deal with a local record label, Smekkleysa (Bad Taste). In 1997, they released Von (Hope) and in 1998, released a remix collection named Von brigði. The name is Icelandic wordplay: Vonbrigði means \"disappointment,\" but Von brigði means \"hope alteration.\" (In English, the album is sometimes known by the alternative name \"Recycle Bin.\")\n\nInternational acclaim came with 1999's Ágætis Byrjun (\"An alright start\"), for which the band were joined by Kjartan Sveinsson. The album's reputation slowly spread by word of mouth over the next two years. Soon, many critics worldwide hailed it as one of the best albums of its time, and the band was playing with Radiohead and other big names. Drummer Ágúst left the band after the recording of Ágætis Byrjun and was replaced by Orri Páll Dýrason.\n\nAfter the release of Ágætis Byrjun, the band became perhaps most well known for Birgisson's signature style of playing guitar with the bow from a cello, accentuated with reverb, creating a sweeping, fluid sound that is unique for an electric guitar. \n\nIn early 2001, Sigur Rós set out to record some songs in their newly-completed álafoss swimming pool studio with their friend Steindór Andersen who is a fisherman and chairman of the Icelandic poetry society, Iðunn. Steindór is a chanter\/singer of the traditional Icelandic epic poetry form, called \"rímur,\" for which the band named their next EP, Rímur. Only 1000 copies of the EP were printed and sold in the spring tour of 2001. \n\nIn 2002, their highly anticipated follow-up album ( ) was released. Upon release, all tracks on the album were untitled, though the band later published song names on their website. Famously, all of the lyrics on ( ) are sung in vonlenska (\"Hopelandic\"), nonsensical vocalizations that resemble the sound of the Icelandic language. It has also been said that the listener is supposed to interpret their own meanings of the lyrics, which can then be written in the blank pages in the album booklet.\n\nIn October of 2003, Sigur Rós joined Radiohead in composing music for Merce Cunningham's dance piece Split Sides; Sigur Rós’s three tracks were named \"Ba Ba,\" \"Ti Ki,\" and \"Di Do\" and released in March of 2004 on an EP titled Ba Ba Ti Ki Di Do The three songs are separate tracks, but the band intended that all three be played at the same time to form one single song. The band's 1997 debut album Von also finally found a United States and United Kingdom release in October of 2004. Their latest full-length album, Takk... (Thanks...), was released on September 13, 2005, with a free legal download of their first single, \"Glósóli,\" made available on August 15. For North American fans, \"Sæglópur\" was made available for download on August 16.\"Hoppípolla,\" the second official single from Takk..., was released on November 28 alongside a new studio remake of \"Hafsól,\" a song which was previously released on the band's 1997 debut, Von. \n\nSæglópur EP was released on July 10 in most parts of the world and on August 8 in the United States. Its original release date was May 8, but because of the sudden demand of \"Hoppípolla,\" especially in the UK due to its inclusion on BBC's \"Planet Earth,\" it was pushed back from that date. Sigur Rós recorded three new songs for the EP: \"Refur,\" \"Ófriður,\" and \"Kafari.\"\n\nThe Hvarf\/Heim double album was released on November 5, 2007. Hvarf contains reworkings of songs dating back to the bands' first album, whereas Heim contains live acoustic versions of more well-known songs. The double album was an accompaniment to the film Heima. Heima is a documentary showing footage of the band's tour of Iceland, including live footage and interviews. The official web site is www.heimafilm.com.\n\nSigur Rós has sold over 2.5 million albums worldwide.\n\nOn June 23, 2008, they released Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust. \nThe single \"Gobbledigook\" was available for a free download on their website.\n\nIn January 2010, the band began a hiatus, and they are now working on new material. On August 11, 2011, the band's website showed a trailer for a project called Inni. A week later, the project was revealed to be a new live album and DVD, although the release date is currently unknown.\n\nSigur Rós'' sixth studio album, Valtari, was released on May 29, 2012 on Parlophone.\n\nIn January 2013, Kjartan Sveinsson left the band and was not replaced. Sigur Rós's first album following his departure was titled Kveikur and released in June 2013.\n\nIn 2014, the band made a guest appearance in the HBO show 'Game of Thrones,' performing The Rains of Castamere in the 2nd episode of the 4th season.\n\n\nWebsites\nBoth websites include discography, band trivia, song lyrics, and news: http:\/\/www.sigur-ros.co.uk and http:\/\/www.sigurros.com. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/+noredirect\/Sigur+R%C3%B3s\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Los Abuelos de la Nada is a band from Buenos Aires, Argentina formed orginally in 1967 by Miguel Abuelo but disbanded in 1969. After a long journey through Europe, Miguel Abuelo returns to Argentina and reforms the band in 1981. The new band had Abuelo as lead singer, Cachorro López on bass, Andrés Calamaro on vocals and keyboards, Gustavo Bazterrica on guitar, Daniel Melingo on sax, and Polo Corbella on the drums.\nCharly García took the band under his wing after dissolving Serú Girán, and the Abuelos played in García's 1982 Christmas concert. García also drafted López, Melingo and Calamaro for his band, in parallel with their work for the Abuelos. The 1983 debut album included many compositions by Abuelo-López, and a reggae hit by Calamaro's former partner Gringui Herrera, Tristezas de la ciudad (City blues).\nFor their 1983 album, Vasos y Besos, Melingo wrote his own reggae hit: Chala-man, Bazterrica contributed No se desesperen (Don't despair), and Calamaro chimed in with Mil horas (A thousand hours).\nThe band became popular with rockers and more pop-oriented audiences. Especially, Calamaro was favored by teenage girls looking for an \"edgier\" idol than balladeer Alejandro Lerner. The album sold a solid 160,000 records, and was presented in a six-month country-wide tour.\nRecord executives arranged to send the band to Ibiza for the recording of their 1984 album, Himno de mi Corazón (Hymn of my heart). The album became a sales hit as expected. Later that year, Melingo, who was also working with García and another band (Los Twist), called it quits and was replaced by Alfredo Desiata.\nBy early 1985, the band's spirits were damaged due to Bazterrica's cocaine addiction, which eventually had him fired from the band, and the rivalry between Abuelo and Calamaro for top billing.\nAbout that time, Calamaro wrote what would be his last mega-hit with the band: Costumbres argentinas (Argentine habits). Sensing that the band was on the verge of dissolution, the band recorded a live album in the Opera theater in Buenos Aires on May 1985. For the occasion, Gringui Herrera replaced Bazterrica, Juan del Barrio reinforced Calamaro in keyboards, and Melingo played some songs as a guest musician.\nThe band played one last gig on October 1985, in the Vélez Sársfield stadium, to fulfill their contractual obligation to the \"Rock and Pop\" festival which featured INXS. The crowd reacted badly to the band's evident lack of motivation (the pouring rain and the badly mixed sound did not help), and Abuelo was hit in the face by a bottle hurled from the field. The band played the remainder of their set with Abuelo visibly bleeding.\nWith the band dissolved, Abuelo started playing small venues, harking back to his roots of poetry-influenced songwriting. Late in 1986, he drafted Polo Corbella, Kubero Díaz, and sax player Willy Crook to form a new Abuelos band, which recorded Cosas mías in 1987 with relative success.\nIn late 1987, following gallbladder surgery, Miguel Abuelo was diagnosed with AIDS; terminally ill, he died from cardiac arrest a few days after his 42nd birthday, in March 26, 1988. That was the end of the Abuelos as a band; the remaining members reunited several times, with different formations. Notably, Miguel's son Gato played with Calamaro, Bazterrica and Corbella in a 1997 re-union.\nThe rights to the Abuelos de la Nada name were offered by Abuelo's widow Krisha Bogdan to Kubero Díaz, who refused out of respect. At some point during 2001, it was reported that Bogdan and Gato were fighting in court over the rights to the name and to Miguel Abuelo's unpublished recordings. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Los+Abuelos+de+la+Nada\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Men I Trust is Dragos, Emma, Jessy, Mathieu and Alexis. Founded in 2014, the dance band from Montreal, Canada loves smooth sounds, calm melodies and simple rhythms that relax, but make your right foot tap and your chin bounce on the beats. They record, mix, master and shoot their music videos. \n\nJessy and Dragos knew each other since their fourth year of high school. Back then (mid-2000’s), Dragos had somewhat of a background in classical piano and Jessy mastered the dark and esoteric art of the metal guitar solist.\n\nIn 2012, while finishing his master’s degree in audio postproduction at Laval University, Dragos spent most of his days and sleeping hours at the “LARC” studio working on his solo projects. He randomly met Jessy again, who was finishing his bachelor degree in Jazz guitar, in one of the faculty’s hallways and talked about doing a French-Touch \/ Italo-Disco track together. Some weeks later, they did just that. And it worked out so well that they decided to extend their collaboration to a whole project where many singers such as Odile Marmet-Rochefort, Gabrielle Shonk, Helena Deland and Geoffroy Sauvé, would be involved.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2016, all of Jessy’s and Dragos’ releases were made as part of Dragos’ masters and (dropped) PhD studies in order to gain access to the LARC’s infrastructure and to develop a unique sound.\n\n\nEmma was a fortuitous encounter. In 2015 a mutual friend presented her to Dragos through a video posted over the Internet. She was casually singing and playing the guitar around a campfire with some of her friends. Emma’s voice was different, being less clear, more grainy and fragile with a mysterious twist that caught their attention. They reached her and tried recording one song called “Out in myself”, which turned to be one of the band’s easiest to record.\n\nJessy and Dragos then invited her to join them on live shows with Odile at the beginning of 2015. The womans' voices blended wonderfully together and the band got lots of positive feedback from the experience. Emma has been part of Men I Trust since then.\n\nWith their second album “Headroom\", Men I Trust truly became a trio. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Men+I+Trust\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Electronic duo Bob Moses play a potent hybrid of house music and lyrical pop, fusing smooth vocals and guitar licks with club beats. Emerging in 2012 with a series of well-received EPs, the duo earned commercial and critical accolades, including a Grammy nomination for the single \"Tearing Me Up\" off their 2015 debut Days Gone By. Battle Lines followed in 2018, and the duo's third studio album, The Silence in Between, arrived in 2022.\n\nBorn and bred in Brooklyn, New York but with roots in Vancouver, Canada, the history of electronic duo Bob Moses is as curious as the cool house music outfit's name. Members Jimmy Vallance and Tom Howie knew one another from the Vancouver high school they both attended, and were drawn to each other thanks to a shared love of pop-punk bands like Rancid and Green Day. Adulthood found them both in Brooklyn, with Vallance recording Berlin-styled techno while Howie worked in the realm of the singer\/songwriter. Both felt musically stuck and hungered for something new, a problem solved by the simple union of their styles, which created something cool and decidedly \"post-club.\" Named after the urban planner who designed the modern New York City, they became Bob Moses and joined the Scissor & Thread label in 2012 with the EP Hand to Hold. The Far from the Tree EP followed on the label in 2013, and a year later the group released the First to Cry EP on Domino.\n\nIn 2015, the label gathered up all the duo's early EPs for the compilation All in All and also released their debut album, Days Gone By. The single \"Tearing Me Up\" earned them a pair of Grammy nominations, winning for Best Remixed Recording (Non-Classical) with RAC. The buzz surrounding \"Tearing Me Up\" carried them into the next year, with appearances on television shows and a special edition re-release of Days Gone By. In 2018, they issued their sophomore full-length, Battle Lines, featuring the single \"Heaven Only Knows.\" A 2019 Unplugged EP preceded 2020's Desire, which included a collaboration with ZHU as its title track. Falling Into Focus, an hour-long set recorded at the top of an abandoned radio tower in Topanga, California, was released as a live album and performance film in November of 2020. \"Griffith\" and the Elderbrook collaboration \"Inner Light\" were both issued in 2021. The Silence in Between, Bob Moses' third studio full-length, appeared in 2022.\n\nBiography by David Jeffries for ALLMUSIC\n\nThere is another artist with the same name:\n\n2) -Rakalam Bob Moses (b. Jan. 28, 1948) is an American jazz drummer born in New York City. \nMoses played with Roland Kirk in 1964-65 while he was still a teenager. In 1966 he and Larry Coryell formed The Free Spirits, a jazz fusion ensemble, and from 1967 to 1969 he played in Gary Burton's quartet.

The Man centered on frontman John Gourley’s abstract musical approach and corresponding upbringing.  He was raised in a sort of technological isolation: his log cabin home in the winter wasteland of the fringes of Wasilla, Alaska was powered by a generator and had no telephone. Both of his parents helped completely immerse him in the unique lifestyle that comes with a land of seasonal darkness and perpetual cold with their jobs as dog sled mushers. Gourley’s innate curiosity and individual spirit combined with a fascination with science fiction and experiences of homelessness create a distinctly transcendent sound that is always open to interpretation and change. \n\nThe band’s debut album, Waiter: “You Vultures!” was released by Fearless Records on January 24th, 2006.\n\nOn June 22, 2007 they released their second full length, Church Mouth.

The track, \"Sumatran Tiger\" does not officially exist digitally, and the copies were sent to \"400 carefully chosen influencers, among them actors, activists, musicians, conservationists, bloggers and journalists,\" and is, as the band claims, \"the first song meant to go extinct unless it's reproduced.\" The band encouraged fans to \"scour the Internet\" using the hashtags #EndangeredSong and #SumatranTiger to find recordings of the song.\n\nIn November 2014, Portugal.

The album's title was inspired by an original 1969 Woodstock music festival ticket stub owned by Gourley's father. It led Gourley to a realization that almost 50 years later, music has the same mission as then – \"to comment on societal and political unease.\" \"We worked with so many rad people on this album, but ended up with just the four of us in a basement at 4 a.m. trying to say something that mattered,\" said Gourley. \"Trying to write music that would help people feel they're not alone, even if they're angry or feeling lost.\" Woodstock was released on June 16, 2017. John Gourley and Zoe Manville married on New Year's Eve 2017. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Portugal.+The+Man\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Mother Mother is an indie rock band which formed in Quadra Island, British Columbia, Canada in 2005. The band consists of Ryan Guldemond (vocals, guitar), Molly Guldemond (vocals, keyboards), Jasmin Parkin (keyboards, vocals), Jeremy Page (bass) and Ali Saidat (drums). So far they have released ten albums: Touch Up (2007), O My Heart (2008), Eureka (2011), The Sticks (2012), Very Good Bad Thing (2015),  No Culture (2017), Dance And Cry (2018), Inside (2021), Grief Chapter (2024), and their latest album, DEMMOS (2024), released recently on November 14th, 2024.\n\nThe band began in Vancouver in January 2005, when guitarist and vocalist Ryan Guldemond was at music school and wanted to start a band based around vocal-driven pop songs. He recruited his sister Molly along with a friend from college, Debra-Jean Creelman, to accompany his own vocals for the songs he had written, and the trio played as an acoustic act before adding drummer Kenton Loewen and bassist Jeremy Page.\n\nThe five members started off playing under the name Mother, and in the fall of 2005, they independently released a self-titled album. This debut album was recorded with Howard Redekopp, who had also worked with The New Pornographers and Tegan and Sara. When the Vancouver Province rated Mother as one of the top five BC bands to watch for in 2007, they began to receive acclaim for their debut album. Shortly thereafter, Mother landed a nationally broadcasted concert opening for K'naan and The Wailin' Jennys. In the summer of 2006, they opened for the Australian band, The Cat Empire, at the sold-out Vancouver International Jazz Festival. Later that year, they made their debut in central Canada at the Montreal International Jazz Festival on June 29 as well as in Toronto on July 1, Canada Day, at the Harbourfront Centre.\n\nIn October 2006, after playing a set at the Pop Montreal festival, Mother met with Last Gang Records and later signed a four-album contract. At that point the label encouraged the band to change their name to avoid legal issues, so rather than changing it completely they decided to simply rename themselves Mother Mother. On February 20, 2007, the band re-released its debut album under the new name, renaming the album Touch Up and including two new songs, as well as artwork and overdubs different from the original.\n\nThe band released their second album, O My Heart, in 2008. In December 3, it was announced that Debra-Jean Creelman had left Mother Mother, with the addition of a new singer\/keyboardist, Jasmin Parkin, announced in January 2009.\n\nMother Mother's third album, Eureka, was released on March 15, 2011. The album's lead single, \"The Stand,\" entered the Canada Singles Top 100 chart in May 2011 and peaked during that week at position 76. The album prompted a reviewer at the Toronto Star to describe the band as \"evolving into orchestral harmonies and hip hop-influenced power ballads, as if Adam Lambert had joined The Dirty Projectors.\" On January 9, 2012, Kraft Foods launched a series of television commercials featuring the song \"Bright Idea.\"\n\nMother Mother's fourth album, The Sticks, was released on September 18, 2012. It contains 14 tracks and was co-produced by band frontman Ryan Guldemond and producer Ben Kaplan.

        "biografia":"Scorpions is a German rock\/heavy metal band formed in Hanover in 1965 by guitarist Rudolf Schenker. Since the band's inception, its musical style has ranged from hard rock, heavy metal and glam metal to soft rock. The lineup from 1978 to 1992 was the most successful incarnation of the group, and included Klaus Meine (vocals), Rudolf Schenker (rhythm guitar), Matthias Jabs (lead guitar), Francis Buchholz (bass), and Herman Rarebell (drums). The band's only continuous member has been Schenker, although Meine has appeared on all of Scorpions' studio albums, while Jabs has been a consistent member since 1978, and bassist Paweł Mąciwoda and drummer Mikkey Dee have been in the band since 2003 and 2016 respectively.\n\nDuring the mid-1970s, with guitarist Uli Jon Roth (who replaced Schenker's younger brother Michael) part of the lineup, the music of the Scorpions was defined as hard rock. After Roth's departure in 1978, Schenker and Meine took control of the group, giving them almost all the power to compose music and write lyrics. Matthias Jabs joined in 1978, and with the melodic rock he played and the influence of producer Dieter Dierks in the band, the Scorpions changed their sound to melodic heavy metal mixed with lyrical \"power rock ballads\", which is evident in the album Lovedrive (1979), which began the evolution of the band's sound, with recording a developed later in several of their albums. Michael Schenker also played on the Lovedrive album. Over the next decade, the band achieved influence, approval from music critics, and significant commercial success with the albums Animal Magnetism (1980), Blackout (1982), Love at First Sting (1984), the live recording World Wide Live (1985), Savage Amusement (1988), their best-selling compilation Best of Rockers 'n' Ballads (1989), and Crazy World (1990), all awarded at least one platinum award in the United States. The band has released thirteen consecutive studio albums that were in the top 10 in Germany, one of which reached No. 1, as well as three consecutive albums that were in the top 10 in the Billboard 200 in the United States. Their latest studio album, Rock Believer, was released in February 2022.\n\nScorpions are estimated to have sold over 100 million records around the world, making them one of the best-selling hard rock and heavy metal bands. One of their most recognized hits is \"Wind of Change\" (from Crazy World), a symbolic anthem of the political changes in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s and the fall of the Berlin Wall, and it remains as one of the best-selling singles in the world with over 14 million copies. Two of the songs on their ninth studio album Love at First Sting, \"Rock You Like a Hurricane\" and \"Still Loving You\", are regarded as some of the most influential and popular works, both in heavy metal music and among rock ballads, defined as \"rock anthem\" and \"a true hymn of love\".\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scorpions_(band)\n\nDiscography\nLonesome Crow (1972)\nFly to the Rainbow (1974)\nIn Trance (1975)\nVirgin Killer (1976)\nTaken by Force (1977)\nLovedrive (1979)\nAnimal Magnetism (1980)\nBlackout (1982)\nLove at First Sting (1984)\nSavage Amusement (1988)\nCrazy World (1990)\nFace the Heat (1993)\nPure Instinct (1996)\nEye II Eye (1999)\nUnbreakable (2004)\nHumanity: Hour I (2007)\nSting in the Tail (2010)\nReturn to Forever (2015)\nRock Believer (2022) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Scorpions\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Pixies is an American alternative rock band which formed in Boston, Massachusetts, United States in 1986. The band consists of Charles (Black Francis) Thompson IV (vocals, guitar; also known as ''Frank Black''), Joey Santiago (lead guitar),   David Lovering (drums) and Emma Richardson (bass, vocals). Until 2013, the band also featured  Kim Deal on bass and vocals. From 2016 until 2024 the band also featured Paz Lechantin on bass and vocals.   The band officially split in 1993  and reunited in 2004. They went on hiatus in 2007, with each band member pursuing projects of their own, only to reunite in 2009, with the announcement of a new tour commencing in Europe that summer.\n\nAlthough quite popular on alternative rock radio in the United States due to heavy airplay of the singles \"Monkey Gone to Heaven\" and \"Here Comes Your Man\", they were never widely popular there, but found success in Europe, especially in the UK (where they managed three top 40 singles \"Velouria\", \"Planet of Sound\" and a re-release of \"Debaser\") and Belgium and the Netherlands, where they were heavily broadcasted by alternative public radio. \n\nThe band's style of alternative rock music is heavily influenced by punk and surf rock, and while highly melodic, is capable of being tremendously abrasive at the same time. Francis is the Pixies' primary songwriter and singer and has a distinctly desperate, yowling delivery. He has typically written cryptic songs about offbeat subjects, such as UFOs and surrealism. References to mental instability, violent Biblical imagery, and physical injury feature in many of the band's songs.\n\nThe group is frequently posited as the immediate forebear of the alternative rock boom of the 1990s, though they disbanded before reaping any of the benefits this might have brought them. Avowed fan Kurt Cobain's acknowledgement of the debt Nirvana owed to the Pixies, along with similar tributes by other alternative bands, ensured that the Pixies' legacy and influence grew substantially in the years following their demise.\n\nIn 1993, during an interview with BBC Radio 5, Black Francis announced that the band had split - something he had not told his bandmates. After the interview, he called Santiago, who in turn faxed Deal and Lovering the news the next morning. After the split, Black Francis inverted his stage name to Frank Black and embarked on a successful solo career, while Deal resumed her role in The Breeders with her identical twin sister Kelley. In 2004, the band reunited for a tour - documented in the film loudQUIETloud - and released a new single, \"Bam Thwok\" that summer. In 2007, Black Francis (now going by that name again) stated in an interview that the reunion was \"done\" even though the members remain in good terms with each other. In later interviews however, he began to mention that he might be willing to record another Pixies album. Nonetheless, Francis has returned to his solo career and Deal to the Breeders, both of which released albums and toured in 2008. Lovering and Santiago, meanwhile, set up their own project, a band called Everybody.\n\nIn order to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the release of Doolittle, Pixies launched a tour in October 2009, on which they perform all the album's songs and B-sides. In the autumn of 2011 the \"Lost Cities\" tour continued the \"Doolittle Tour\" as they played many venues for the first time. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Pixies\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Teddy was exposed to a wider variety of music than most “country boys”. In high school and over the next few years he was in several bands, genres ranging from 80’s hair metal, funk, modern metalcore, soul, and country alternative bands. \nThese experiences make Teddy who he is as an artist.\n\nIn March of 2019, Teddy went on his first US tour as a hip-hop artist with his best friend Addy Maxwell, which he describes as freeing experience, as he was able to continue to expand into uncharted territory. With this in mind, Teddy began to explore integrating the various genres he loved: metal, pop-punk, soul\/funk, country, gospel, r&b, and show-tunes, into one genre that is Teddy Swims.\n\nTeddy is the accumulation of past projects. Swims stands for: someone who isn’t me sometimes, a reference to Teddy’s struggle to integrate the different parts of himself. For Teddy, the goal is to break barriers and bring people together. About the project, Teddy says, “There are no categories, no stereotypes, no statistic is a definite number. Until we learn to see every person as an individual, we will never truly reach unity.”\n\nHe is known for breaking Billboard Hot 100 records with “Lose Control” and is known as “Post Malone when he’s 50” by Canadian YouTuber and musician Steven “Stevie T” Terreberry. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Teddy+Swims\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Jagger's distinctive voice and performance, along with Keith Richards' guitar style, have been the trademark of the Rolling Stones throughout the career of the band. Jagger gained press notoriety for his admitted drug use and romantic involvements, and was often portrayed as a countercultural figure.\nIn the late 1960s, Jagger began acting in films (starting with Performance and Ned Kelly), to mixed reception. In 1985, he released his first solo album, She's the Boss. In early 2009, Jagger joined the electric supergroup SuperHeavy. In 1989 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 2004 into the UK Music Hall of Fame with the Rolling Stones. In 2003, he was knighted for his services to popular music.\n\nWhile continuing to tour and release albums with the Rolling Stones, Jagger began a solo career. In 1985 he released his first solo album She's the Boss, produced by Nile Rodgers and Bill Laswell, and featuring Herbie Hancock, Jeff Beck, Jan Hammer, Pete Townshend and the Compass Point All Stars. It sold fairly well, and the single \"Just Another Night\" was a Top Ten hit. During this period, he collaborated with the Jacksons on the song \"State of Shock\", sharing lead vocals with Michael Jackson.\n\nFor his own personal contributions in the 1985 Live Aid multi-venue charity concert, he performed at Philadelphia's JFK Stadium; he did a duet with Tina Turner of \"It's Only Rock and Roll\", and the performance was highlighted by Jagger tearing away Turner's skirt. He also did a cover of \"Dancing in the Street\" with David Bowie, who himself appeared at Wembley Stadium. The video was shown simultaneously on the screens of both Wembley and JFK Stadiums. The song reached number one in the UK the same year. In 1987 he released his second solo album, Primitive Cool. While it failed to match the commercial success of his debut, it was critically well received. In 1988 he produced the songs \"Glamour Boys\" and \"Which Way to America\" on Living Colour's album Vivid. Between 15 and 28 March he had a solo concert tour in Japan (Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka).\n\nWandering Spirit was the third solo album by Jagger and was released in 1993. It would be his only solo album release of the 1990s. Jagger aimed to re-introduce himself as a solo artist in a musical climate vastly changed from that of his first two albums, She's the Boss and Primitive Cool.\n\nFollowing the successful comeback of the Rolling Stones' Steel Wheels (1989), which saw the end of Jagger and Richards' well-publicised feud, after acquiring Rick Rubin as co-producer in January 1992 Jagger began recording the album in Los Angeles over seven months until September 1992, recording simultaneously as Richards was making Main Offender.\n\nJagger would keep the celebrity guests to a minimum on Wandering Spirit, only having Lenny Kravitz as a vocalist on his cover of Bill Withers' \"Use Me\" and bassist Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers on three tracks. Following the end of the Rolling Stones' Sony Music contract and their signing to Virgin Records, Jagger signed with Atlantic Records (which had signed the Stones in the 1970s) to distribute what would be his only album with the label. Released in February 1993, Wandering Spirit was commercially successful, reaching No.12 in the UK and No.11 in the US.\n\nIn 2001 Jagger released Goddess in the Doorway spawning the hit single \"Visions of Paradise\". In the same year he also joined Keith Richards in the Concert for New York City, a charity concert in response to the 11 September attacks, to sing \"Salt of the Earth\" and \"Miss You\".\n\nHe celebrated the Rolling Stones' 40th anniversary by touring with them on the year-long Licks Tour in support of their career retrospective Forty Licks double album.\n\nIn 2007 the Rolling Stones made US$437 million on their A Bigger Bang Tour, which got them into the current edition of Guinness World Records for the most lucrative music tour.[35] Jagger has refused to say when the band will retire, stating in 2007: \"I'm sure the Rolling Stones will do more things and more records and more tours. We've got no plans to stop any of that really.\"\n\nIn October 2009 Jagger and U2 performed \"Gimme Shelter\" (with Fergie and will.i.am) and \"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\" at the 25th Anniversary Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Concert.\n\nOn 20 May 2011 Jagger announced the formation of a new supergroup, SuperHeavy, which includes Dave Stewart, Joss Stone, Damian Marley and A.R. Rahman.[38] Jagger has featured on will.i.am's 2011 single \"T.H.E. (The Hardest Ever)\". It was officially released to iTunes on 4 February 2012.\n\nOn 21 February 2012 Mick Jagger, B.B. King, Buddy Guy and Jeff Beck, along with a blues ensemble, performed at the White House concert series before President Barack Obama. When Jagger held out a mic to him, Obama sang twice the line \"Come on, baby don't you want to go\" of the blues cover 'Sweet Home Chicago', the blues anthem of Obama's home town.\n\nJagger hosted the season finale of Saturday Night Live on 19 and 20 May 2012, doing several comic skits and playing some of the Rolling Stones' hits with Arcade Fire, Foo Fighters, and Jeff Beck.\n\nJagger performed in 12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief with the Rolling Stones on 12 December 2012. The Stones finally played the Glastonbury festival in 2013, headlining on Saturday 29 June. This was followed by two concerts in London's Hyde Park as part of their 50th anniversary celebrations, their first in the Park since their famous 1969 performance. In 2013 Mick Jagger teamed up with his brother Chris Jagger for two new duets to mark the 40th anniversary of Chris' debut album.\n\n\nBorn Michael Phillip Jagger on July 26, 1943, in Dartford, England, he initially met future musical collaborator and Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards while the pair were five years old at primary school, although they would lose contact with each other shortly thereafter. In the intervening years, Jagger discovered a love for music, especially early rock & roll (forming a high school band, Little Boy Blue & the Blue Boys), as well as developing an interest in business, attending the London School of Economics.\n\nIn 1960 in his late teens, Jagger happened to bump into Richards once again (while the two were waiting on a train platform), and when Richards noticed Jagger had several blues records under his arm, they became friends again and started up the Rolling Stones shortly thereafter. The band (which also included second guitarist Brian Jones, bassist Bill Wyman, and drummer Charlie Watts), merged the rock & roll of Chuck Berry with the raw blues of Muddy Waters, creating a style that would be infinitely copied by others in its wake. By the late '60s, the Rolling Stones were rivaling the Beatles as the world's most popular rock band (with their second guitarist slot rotating from time to time), issuing such classic singles as \"Paint It Black,\" \"Time Is on My Side,\" \"Get Off of My Cloud,\" \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,\" \"Jumpin' Jack Flash,\" and others. In 1968, they began a string of albums that would go down as some of rock's most quintessential and enduring albums ever recorded -- 1968's Beggar's Banquet, 1969's Let It Bleed, 1970's Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out, 1971's Sticky Fingers, and 1972's Exile on Main Street.\n\nDuring this time, Jagger also tried his hand at acting in movies, landing roles in such flicks as Performance and Ned Kelly (both from 1970). Jagger also became a renowned playboy and jet setter among other celebrities. As a result (as well as the Stones' escalating drug abuse), the quality of the Stones' music began to suffer -- while they remained one of the world's top concert draws and beloved bands, they issued albums of varying quality from the mid-'70s through the early '80s. Around this time, Jagger and Keith Richards conflicted over the musical direction of the band. Jagger wanted to move the band in a more pop and dance-oriented direction while Richards wanted to stay true to the band's rock & roll and blues roots. By 1984, Jagger had begun recording a solo album where he pursued a more mainstream, dance-inflected pop direction. The resulting album, She's the Boss, was released in 1985. Jagger filmed a number of state-of-the-art videos for the album, which all received heavy airplay from MTV, helping propel the record's first single, \"Just Another Night,\" to number 12 and the album to platinum status. \"Lucky in Love,\" the second single from the album scraped the bottom of the Top 40. In the summer of 1985, Jagger and David Bowie recorded a cover of Martha & the Vandellas' \"Dancing in the Street\" for the Live Aid organization. The single peaked at number seven on the U.S. pop charts; all the proceeds from its sale were donated to Live Aid.\n\nAround the same time the Rolling Stones released their 1986 album, Dirty Work, Jagger released the theme song from the movie Ruthless People as a single and told Richards that the Stones would not tour to support Dirty Work. For the next few years, Jagger and Richards barely spoke to each other and sniped at the other in the press. During this time, Jagger tried to make his solo career as successful as the Rolling Stones, pouring all of his energy into his second solo album, 1987's Primitive Cool. Although the album received stronger reviews than She's the Boss, only one of the singles -- \"Let's Work\" -- scraped the bottom of the Top 40 and the record didn't go gold.\n\nFollowing the commercial failure of Primitive Cool, Jagger returned to the fold of the Rolling Stones in 1989, recording, releasing, and touring the Steel Wheels album. Steel Wheels was a massively successful venture and after the tour was completed, the Stones entered a slow period, where each of the members pursued solo projects. Jagger recorded his third solo album with Rick Rubin, who had previously worked with the Beastie Boys and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The resulting solo album, Wandering Spirit, was released in 1993 and received the strongest reviews of any of Jagger's solo efforts. The album entered the U.S. charts at number 11 and went gold the year it was released. A year after the release of Wandering Spirit, the Stones reunited and released Voodoo Lounge, supporting the album with another extensive international tour. During the '90s, Jagger also resumed his movie acting career, with roles in Freejack (1992), Bent (1997), and The Man From Elysian Fields (2001).\n\nIn 1997, the Stones regrouped for another new album, Bridges to Babylon, and a subsequent tour of stadiums worldwide. 2001 saw the release of Jagger's first solo album in nearly ten years, titled Goddess in the Doorway, which included guest appearances from such rock big names as Pete Townshend, Bono, Lenny Kravitz, Missy \"Misdemeanor\" Elliot, Joe Perry, Wyclef Jean, and Rob Thomas.\n\nIn addition to his work with the Rolling Stones and solo releases, Jagger has guested on albums by a wide variety of other artists -- the Jacksons, Peter Tosh, Carly Simon, Dr. John, and Living Colour, among others (the latter he helped discover and produced part of their hit debut album, Vivid).  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Mick+Jagger\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"H.E.A.T (also known as simply Heat) is a melodic hard rock band that formed in Sweden in the year 2007. Rising from the merger of local groups Dream and Trading Fate, the guys released their self-titled debut album in 2008. Inspired by arena rock, classic metal, and power pop bands of the 70s and 80s, the group achieved international notoriety in the 2010s after taking in retro-rocker and TV star Erik Grönwall.\n\nIn 2007, they gained energy as an opening act to Toto, and the following year they got a massive break serving as an opening act to heavy metal legends Alice Cooper and Sabaton. The band performed at the Sweden Rock Festival that year as well. Their sound earned them the Årets Nykomlingar award, given out by the Swedish radio station P4 Dist for the best new artist as voted by the listeners. In 2009, the band played at the Melodifestivalen 2009, the Swedish qualifier to the annual Eurovision Song Contest, and made it to the final round with the song \"1000 Miles\". The band also toured around Europe as an opening act to Edguy that year.\n\nThe 2008 release of H.e.a.t was followed up by 2010's Freedom Rock. Continuing their high-energy yet slick style, it was ranked in the \"Top Ten AOR\/Melodic Rock Albums of 2010\" by Classic Rock Magazine. Vocalist Kenny Leckremo's departure from H.E.A.T in mid-2010 brought a major change as retro-rocker and TV star Erik Grönwall became the band's new frontman. The singer had won the program Swedish Idol in December 2009, playing material by the likes of Iron Maiden and Skid Row (a huge change from the mellow pop ballads often seen on Swedish TV).\n\nThe groups's first two albums with Grönwall on the mic, 2012's Address the Nation and 2014's Tearing Down the Walls, earned a positive fan response and international acclaim. Sleaze Roxx remarked that if \"you haven’t yet heard Tearing Down The Walls yet, give yourself a... present by purchasing what is sure to be a contender for record of the year.\" The guys' latest release is 2017's Into the Great Unknown, their third with vocalist Erik Grönwall. The album saw the return of former guitarist Dave Dalone, who rejoined the band after the departure of Eric Rivers in 2016. Dave Ling of Classic Rock Magazine published the following quote in his review of Into the Great Unknown: \"H.E.A.T. have just made the most complete album of their career. Watch their rise continue.\"\n\nH.E.A.T released H.E.A.T II on 21 February 2020, returning to their heavier sound.  On 30 October 2020, the band announced via their official Facebook page that original singer Kenny Leckremo has rejoined the band replacing the departing singer Erik Grönwall.\n\n 2025 - H.E.A.T unveiled their studio album Welcome To The Future, released on April 25, 2025.\n\nThe current members of the band are:\nKenny Leckremo – lead vocals, guitar (2007–2010, 2020-present)\nDave Dalone - Guitars\nJona Tee - Keyboards\nJimmy Jay - Bass\nDon Crash - Drums\n\nFormer members:\nEric Rivers (Erik Hammarbäck) – guitars, backing vocals (2007–2016)\nErik Grönwall – lead vocals, rhythm guitar, harmonica (2010–2020)\n\nStudio albums\nH.E.A.T -  (2008)\nFreedom Rock - (2010)\nAddress the Nation - (2012)\nTearing Down the Walls - (2014)\nInto the Great Unknown - (2017)\nH.E.A.T II - (2020)\nForce Majeure - (2022)\n\nTheir official website is at: www.heatsweden.com <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/H.E.A.T\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Ash Blue Gutierrez, professionally known as glaive, is an American musician and producer who gained recognition in 2020 from the hyperpop community on SoundCloud. Born on January 20, 2005 in Florida, Gutierrez moved to North Carolina at a young age and is based there. He first began creating music early in the COVID-19 pandemic while attending high school online, recording his initial songs in his bedroom and quickly drawing an audience on SoundCloud with his distinctive blend of hyperpop and emo-influenced pop. Despite being associated with hyperpop, he has described much of his work as ‘plain pop,’ expressing a desire to expand beyond genre labels.\n\nAfter uploading several tracks to SoundCloud, glaive caught the attention of Interscope Records, which signed him later in 2020. His debut EP, cypress grove, released that same year, was followed by all dogs go to heaven in 2021 and its deluxe edition, old dog, new tricks, in early 2022. His collaboration with ericdoa on their joint EP then i'll be happy led to a co-headlining tour across North America with fellow hyperpop and digicore artists like midwxst and aldn. In 2023, he released his debut full-length album, i care so much that i dont care at all, which was supported by singles like “as if” , “all i do is try my best” and also included \"the prom\" which would boom in popularity 2 years later. \n\nIn early 2024, glaive released the EP a bit of a mad one featuring tracks such as “huh” and “i don't really feel it anymore.” Shortly afterward, he announced his departure from Interscope Records to pursue music independently. As an immediate result of this departure, he would release the single “tijuana freestyle” after stating how it was blocked from release by Interscope.\n\nLater that year, he would begin the rollout for his sophomore album, May It Never Falter, after teasing the project on social media. It was lead by the sole single “Live & Direct” with kurtains - marking the first feature on a solo glaive project.\n\nOn September 26, 2025, glaive released his third studio album, \"Y'all.\" It was released under the \"Broke\" label and the slowsilver03 imprint, a group which glaive is apart of. He first began to tease this album when he released the opening track \"Asheville\" on July 18, 2025.\n\nKnown for themes of frustration, alienation, and emotional intensity, glaive’s work frequently explores mental health and youthful angst, combining elements of emo, pop, trap, and indie rock. Although often associated with hyperpop and digicore, glaive's music has evolved into a more mainstream pop sound, influenced by genres like Midwest emo and pop punk. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/glaive\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. Known as the \"King of Pop,\" he is widely recognized as one of the most influential figures in popular music during the 20th century. His career spanned more than four decades, during which he broke racial barriers in the music industry and became a global icon. Jackson popularized street dance moves such as the moonwalk, the robot, and the anti-gravity lean, and he is frequently cited as one of the greatest entertainers of all time.\n\nThe eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson began performing publicly at age six as the lead singer of the Jackson 5, one of Motown's successful acts. He launched his solo career with the album \"Off the Wall\" (1979) and achieved unprecedented success with \"Thriller\" (1982), the best-selling album of all time. The short film-style music videos for \"Thriller\", \"Beat It\", and \"Billie Jean\" helped establish music videos as a prominent art form. Jackson's subsequent album, \"Bad\" (1987), produced five US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles: \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\", \"Bad\", \"The Way You Make Me Feel\", \"Man in the Mirror\", and \"Dirty Diana\". His later albums \"Dangerous\" (1991) and \"HIStory\" (1995) explored socially conscious themes, while \"Invincible\" (2001) focused on personal topics.\n\nFrom the mid-1980s, Jackson's changing appearance, personal relationships, and lifestyle drew public attention. He faced allegations of child sexual abuse in 1993 and was later tried and acquitted of further allegations in 2005. Jackson died in 2009 from a propofol overdose administered by his personal physician, Conrad Murray, who was later convicted of involuntary manslaughter. His death prompted worldwide media coverage, significant increases in music sales, and a widely viewed televised memorial service at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.\n\nJackson is among the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales exceeding 500 million records. He holds a joint record for a male solo artist with 13 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles and is the only artist to have a top-ten single in six consecutive decades. He received 13 Grammy Awards, the Grammy Legend Award, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, 26 American Music Awards, 12 World Music Awards, eight MTV Video Music Awards, six Brit Awards, and three presidential honors. Jackson was inducted into multiple halls of fame, including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Dance Hall of Fame. He donated an estimated $500 million to charity during his lifetime. In 2024, half of his music catalog was sold to Sony for $600 million, the largest music acquisition for a single artist.\n\nStudio albums\nGot to Be There (1972)\nBen (1972)\nMusic & Me (1973)\nForever, Michael (1975)\nOff the Wall (1979)\nThriller (1982)\nBad (1987)\nDangerous (1991)\nHIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995)\nInvincible (2001) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Michael+Jackson\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Have you ever asked yourself what life would be like if you were an armless skater? Do you consider yourself a weekend warrior?\nThen State of Mine's fast and melodic skatepunk might be a perfect fit for you. Mostly influenced by the nineties Swedish skatepunk sound, and more established bands as Belvedere, Lagwagon and Man(d)y M(o)ore, State of Mine effectuated more than 75 shows on local and not-so-local stages in Belgium and abroad since November 2007. These shows included support slots for bands as SNFU (Can), Smoke or Fire (USA), Rentokill (Au), Mute (Can), High Five Drive (Can), Pendleton (UK), The Living Daylights (UK), Jet Market (It) and other massively talented, yet less known bands.\n\nA first release followed after nearly a year of constant rehearsing and performing. The DIY \"Geargrinder\" EP sold out within the first months after it's release in October 2008. After a major change in the SoM line up (one guitar less, a replacement behind the drums and a new lead vocal), plans were made for a split CD with The Octopussy's, to be released under Kickass Records (the band’s own D.I.Y. record label) by the end of April 2009.\n\nAfter a rushy 2009 filled with playing shows and promoting the split CD in Belgium, the band scheduled to start writing their debut full album “Accelerate!” around the end of the year. It quickly got clear that the only feasible option was to do the whole thing in a D.I.Y. fashion.\nSlowly, but steadily, the recording sessions for “Accelerate!” started off in April 2010. \nAnd now, at the start of 2011, the band is extremely proud to be able to present the finished album. \n\nNext to that the need for a second guitar player became quite acute going through the recording process. \nVictor Navarro (ex-Struggling for reason) happily filled the vacant spot.\nAs a fivepiece, State of Mine guarantees an energetic live show, spiced up with old and new skatepunk covers.\nAnyone interested in booking State of Mine can contact Jeroen through jare102*at*hotmail*dot*com.\n\nWhite socks prevail!\n\nCurry.

        "biografia":"Arcade Fire is a Canadian indie rock band formed in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 2001. The band consists of Win Butler (vocals, guitar, piano), Régine Chassagne (vocals, accordion, keyboards, hurdy gurdy, drums), Richard Reed Parry (bass, guitar), Tim Kingsbury (bass), and Jeremy Gara (drums). Montreal percussionist Dane Mills performed on the EP and in early live shows.  Will Butler (keyboards, guitar) left the band in 2022 to focus on his solo career. The touring band includes horn players and violinists.\n\nThe band’s trademark fashion consists in wearing rather formal attire during live events and a use of orchestral instruments. When asked about the rumour that the band's name refers to a fire in an arcade, Win Butler replied: \"It's not a rumour, it's based on a story that someone told me. It's not an actual event, but one that I took to be real. I would say that it's probably something that the kid made up, but at the time I believed him.\" Win Butler and his brother Will grew up in Texas.\n\nBand formation\n\nArcade Fire formed around the husband and wife duo of Win Butler and Régine Chassagne. Joining together as recently as mid-2003, the current line-up solidified in late 2003\/early 2004, when their first full-length album Funeral was recorded. Before this an eponymous EP (often referred to by fans as the Us Kids Know EP) had been sold at early shows. The EP was subsequently remastered and given a full release once the band started becoming more prominent. Arcade Fire are known for their enthralling live performances, as well as its use of a large number of musical instruments. In addition to mainstays guitar, drums, and bass guitar, members play piano, violin, viola, cello, double bass, xylophone, keyboard, French horn, accordion, and harp. With several able musicians, the band take most of their instrumental diversity on tour and members switch instrumental duties throughout their shows. The number of instruments, along with a wide set of musical influences has provided a substantial number of resources on which to draw from during the recording process. The promise showed by the band in its live shows allowed it to land a record contract with Chapel Hill-based independent record label Merge Records.\n\nFuneral\n\nWithout a major label backing, the success of the band and the album Funeral has been acclaimed as an Internet phenomenon. After a 9.7 rating from Pitchfork, Merge Records sold out their inventory of Funeral and it became the label's first album in the Billboard 200 chart. An early tip from David Bowie was also influential. The band booked small clubs for their 2004 tour but growing interest forced many venue changes, far beyond the band's expectations, and continued internationally into mid-2005. The MTV2 2005 Review hosted by Zane Lowe named Funeral Album of the Year, and NME named Funeral Number 2 in their list of 2005's best albums and \"Rebellion (Lies)\" the best track. By November 2005, Funeral had gone gold in both Canada and the UK and sold in excess of half a million copies worldwide, a phenomenal number for an independent release with minimal television or radio exposure. It has also surpassed Neutral Milk Hotel's In The Aeroplane Over The Sea as the biggest selling Merge Records album to date.\n\nArcade Fire were featured on the April 4, 2005 cover of Time Magazine's Canadian edition, and hailed as a band who \"helped put Canadian music on the world map\". On April 2, 2006, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, they received the Juno Award for Songwriters Of The Year for three songs from Funeral: \"Wake Up\", \"Rebellion (Lies)\" and \"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\". Arcade Fire then planned to begin recording a follow up to Funeral in the winter of 2005-2006, having bought an old church forty minutes from central Montreal which they converted into a studio. \n\nNeon Bible\n\nIn mid-December 2006 www.neonbible.com went live containing nothing more than a phone number, 1-866-NEONBIBLE where people can listen to a new track called Intervention. Built in the style of customer support lines, the number has other features including a contest and a chance to talk to a live person at a specific time each week. \n\nThen in January 2007, they finally announced that the new album Neon Bible would be released March 5th in UK, March 6th in US. The announcement was made with a video in the album's website, with guitarist Richard Reed Parry using a gramophone and a paper mask of Parry's own face, and sitting on Win Butler´s chair. After the announcement of the album´s release, the website was updated with a streaming version of \"Black Mirror\", new art and a few phone messages sounding like the band´s members.\n\nThe Suburbs\n\nThe band released their third album \"The Suburbs\" on August 2, 2010 in the UK and August 3, 2010 in the United States. It debuted at #1 in both countries. On February 13, 2011, the album won Album of the Year at the 53rd Grammy Awards.\n\nArcade Fire recorded a song for The Hunger Games soundtrack (The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond), called \"Abraham's Daughter\". The song is featured in the movie's end credits. The soundtrack was released on March 20, 2012, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200. It sold more than 175,000 copies in its first week according to Nielsen SoundScan. It's the first theatrical film soundtrack to top the chart since Michael Jackson's \"This Is It\" debuted at No. 1 on the list. It is also only the 16th soundtrack to debut at No. 1 in the history of the Billboard 200 chart (those soundtracks include film, television, and straight-to-video efforts).\n\nReflektor\n\nArcade Fire and Mercury Records confirmed that they would release a fourth album in late 2013. In December 2012, the band's manager Scott Rodger confirmed that Arcade Fire was in the studio working with James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem. The official Arcade Fire pre-order website sets the release date on October 28, 2013. The band announced on January 18, 2013 that they were selling the church they had been using as a studio due to a collapsed roof. Throughout 2013, the band worked on the album in several different recording studios - including Murphy's DFA Records studio in New York. On June 22, 2013, Rolling Stone reported that new material from the album would be released on September 9, 2013.\n\nEverything Now\n\nArcade Fire's first announced its fifth record, \"Everything Now,\" on May 31, 2017 when it released the record's title track and lead single. The album's release came July 27, 2017. In the weeks leading up to the album's release, the band released three additional lead singles, \"Creature Comfort,\" \"Signs of Life,\" and \"Electric Blue.\" Upon the week of its release, \"Everything Now\" reached #1 on the Billboard 200 chart, becoming the band's third-straight and third overall #1 record.\n\nWE\n\nOn October 21, 2020, Butler was interviewed for the Broken Record podcast, where he commented about Arcade Fire's sixth album.  The band had been writing for a year before the COVID-19 lockdown. In March 2022, fans received postcards marked with the band's logo; the postcards included the note \"We missed you\", musical notations, as well as an image of an eye with the word \"Unsubscribe\" written below. Those same images began to appear in signage around London as well as on the band's social media pages, indicating the earliest signs of a new album. On March 14, the band announced a new song titled \"The Lightning I, II\" would be released on March 17.  \n\nOn March 17, 2022, Arcade Fire announced that the album would be titled WE and be released on May 6, 2022. Later that week, Will Butler announced he had amicably left the band in 2021 shortly after the completion of WE.\n\nFollowing the release of WE on May 6, 2022, Arcade Fire announced the group’s first world tour since 2018, starting in August 2022.  They again appeared on Saturday Night Live on May 7, 2022, playing \"Unconditional I (Lookout Kid)\", \"The Lightning I, II\", and \"End of The Empire II\" over the closing credits. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Arcade+Fire\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Why Don't We (commonly abbreviated as WDW) was an American pop quintet that was assembled on September 27, 2016, consisting of Jonah Marais, Corbyn Besson, Daniel Seavey, Jack Avery, and Zach Herron, each of whom had previously recorded as solo artists. Their fandom name was called \"Limelights\" due to a lyric from their debut single. Because of a lawsuit, the group took a hiatus and cancelled their tour in 2022, and eventually lost the rights to the group name in February 2025, marking the official end of the group.\n\nThe band was originally formed on September 27, 2016, and announced it the next day via their YouTube account. Over the span of six years, the band released two albums and six EPs.\n\nOn October 7, 2016, the group released their debut single \"Taking You\", a track from their debut EP, Only the Beginning, which was released on November 25 of the same year. They embarked on their first headlining tour, the \"Taking You Tour\", the next year. Their second EP, Something Different, was released on April 21, 2017. Its title track was released as the lead single the same day. Following the release of their second EP, they embarked on the \"Something Different Tour\", their second headlining tour. They released their third EP, Why Don't We Just, on June 2, 2017. In September 2017, the band signed with Atlantic Records. That same month, Invitation, their fourth EP, was released. On November 23, 2017, they released their fifth EP, A Why Don't We Christmas. In 2018, in support of the Invitation EP, they headlined the \"Invitation Tour\". Additionally the band has appeared in several vlogs of YouTuber Logan Paul.\n\nThey released their debut album 8 Letters on August 31, 2018. It debuted and peaked at number 9 on the US Billboard 200, and was preceded by three singles: \"Hooked\", \"Talk\", and \"8 Letters\". In March 2019, they embarked on the \"6 Letters Tour\".\n\nWhy Don't We released a new song each month in 2019, with the most notable being \"Big Plans\" on January 16, \"I Don't Belong in This Club\" featuring American rapper Macklemore on March 20, \"Unbelievable\" on May 16, \"What Am I\" (penned by Ed Sheeran) on August 23, and \"Chills\" on December 30.\n\nOn September 29, 2020, the band released \"Fallin' (Adrenaline)\", the lead single from their second album, The Good Times and the Bad Ones. It debuted at number 37 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, their first ever entry. Their second single from the album, \"Lotus Inn\", was released on December 4, 2020. They starred in a YouTube documentary titled 30 Days With, which showed the last stages of development and behind the scenes content of their then-upcoming album for 30 days. Their third single from the album, \"Slow Down\", was released on December 17, 2020. On January 15, 2021, the quintet released their sophomore album The Good Times and The Bad Ones. The album was largely self-produced, though it also features the productions of Travis Barker, Skrillex, and Timbaland. The album debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, making it their highest entry on the chart.\n\nThe band released the single \"Love Back\" on October 6, 2021. The band then released a cover of Justin Bieber's \"Mistletoe\" in December that same year.\n\nIn January 2022, they released Don't Wake Me Up, a collaboration with Jonas Blue. Throughout the year, the band began releasing self-written music, including Let Me Down Easy (Lie), Just Friends, and How Do You Love Somebody. \n\nThey had originally planned to go on tour in North America, The Good Times Only Tour, in June 2022, but because of ongoing legal battles with their former management, the band postponed the tour to July but ultimately cancelled it, beginning an official hiatus.\n\nAfter 4 years of legal battles, a trial was finally held in February 2025. Concluding on the 27th, it ended with a mixed verdict. The members (excluding Daniel) would only need to pay a dollar each for breach of contract, but they lost the 'Why Don't We' name and brand to Signature. With this verdict, the band officially ended. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Why+Don%27t+We\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Madrugada\n«Chimes at Midnight»\n\nWhen Madrugada regrouped to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of their classic debut album «Industrial Silence» in 2019, they quickly realised that interest in the band had not waned in their absence. It had, in fact, increased, not least on the European continent.\n\nWhat’s more, they realised that they loved being back together. Being in Madrugada had never been quite this much fun.\n\nSays vocalist and guitarist Sivert Høyem: «It was if as the last piece of the puzzle had snapped into place. I’d never felt so self-assured on stage before. It was no stress at all, whereas in the past it had always been very stressful to me».\n\nThe tour was a triumph, with the band selling out shows in the their native Norway, plenty of festival dates and a host of concerts throughout Europe, where the band now sold out halls that were twice the size of the places they used to play back in the day.\n\n10 years on from when the band called it a day after guitarist Robert Burås passed, the three remaining original members – Høyem, Frode Jacobsen (bass) and Jon Lauvland Pettersen (drums) – felt rejuvenated and ready for more.\n\nThey wanted to play more shows. In order to do so, new music had to be made. The trip they were on couldn’t be strictly nostalgic. And so it was that Madrugada, a band that usually takes its sweet time to agree on just about anything, ran straight off the stage and back into the rehearsal room in December 2019.\n\nJacobsen: «We were on a tight schedule. We booked time at Sunset Sound Studio in Los Angeles at the end of February, and had about a month and a half to come up with the material and whip it into shape. It went rather swimmingly. We were still high from touring, raring to go».\n\nHøyem: «Everyone brought something – melodies, ideas – to the table. And then we’d all be let loose on it. We had the «Industrial Silence» album in our bloodstreams after playing it live on the tour, and I felt there was a direct line back to our formative years. Everything came out sounding like Madrugada».\n\nThe band worked in their own rehearsal space\/studio in Oslo, in another studio, Velvet Recordings, 45 minutes outside the city, and spent a further week woodshedding in Berlin. 70% of the material they came up with, is spanking new. But they also rescued a couple of older songs from oblivion. «The World Could Be Falling Down» hails from the time of their first album. «Slowly Turns The Wheel» first reared its head somewhere between the third and the fourth.\n\nLauvland Pettersen: «The process was very different from when I recorded my last album with the band [«The Nightly Disease», 2011]. That was a case of ‘second album syndrome’. We didn’t have much going in, and had to come up with the goods on the clock. This time the material was not only written, but thoroughly arranged too».\n\nThe band arrived in Los Angeles in late February, happy to be recording in a legendary studio where classic albums by Led Zeppelin, Fleetwood Mac, The Doors and the Rolling Stones had been conceived.\n\nLauvland Pettersen: «It was a boyhood dream come true, for sure. A terrific gift: I’m here, I’m with my dear friends and we’re having the time of our lives».\n\nProducer Kevin Ratterman (Ray LaMontagne, My Morning Jacket, The Flaming Lips) was waiting for them, and the plan was once again to get in the flow and work fast.\nThe band had given themselves two weeks to put the music, recorded live in the studio, to analogue tape. They met their deadline, and a good thing too. No sooner was the last song on the album, «Ecstasy», in the can, before the world as we knew it shut down. It was March 2020, and the plan had been for Madrugada to go home, rest up for a week and return to do overdubs and mix the album in a studio in Silver Lake. Instead, they had to go home, and stay home.\n\nHøyem: «It was a ‘last flight out of Saigon’ kind of scene. And the tickets weren’t cheap».\n\nUp until this point, the making of «Chimes at Midnight» had been a whirlwind affair. When it became obvious that the world would remain in a state of emergency for quite some time, it was important not to lose momentum. The album would have to be finished by unorthodox means:\n\nNamely by Zoom and via big screen-TVs, with Ratterman and the American team on one end in Los Angeles, and Madrugada on the other, in Oslo, Norway. Frustrating? Oh yes. But the esprit de corps remained strong.\n\nJacobsen: «The technology enabled us to do overdubs in real time, with Kevin producing us from the other side of the Atlantic. Unusual, to say the least, and quite interesting. But the process became a lot slower».\n\nIt goes without saying that Høyem, Jacobsen and Lauvland Pettersen are painfully aware that one of Madrugada’s founding members, Robert Burås, very sadly isn’t around to work his magic anymore. But what other developments have the nigh-on 14 years since their fifth and hitherto last album, «Madrugada» (2008), and «Chimes at Midnight», begot?\n\nHøyem: «The songs are a reflection of who we are in the present time. We’re older. We’re all fathers. I believe I have a more nuanced view of life than I had 20 years ago, a greater ability to feel several things at once. Madrugada’s aesthetic was very New York City and Berlin, we were a punk band that played the blues. All those elements remain. But this time around it felt appealing to explore the more dreamy aspects of what we do. The city we recorded in encouraged us to do so».\n\nJacobsen: «Chimes at Midnight» is not a conceptual album, it doesn’t point in one particular direction. That makes it somewhat different, in my mind. But it’s made to played live, just like the other albums».\n\nLauvland Pettersen: «It’s got maybe more of a singer\/songwriter vibe to it, I think. If I want to write a ballad and give it the full orchestral treatment, I’m welcome to do it. It’s been therapeutic too. The shows were pure pleasure, and the album’s given me a feeling of closure».\n\nHøyem: «‘Chimes at Midnight’ was born of an atmosphere of true joy and goodwill. To me, it’s a passionate album».\n\nThe members’ respect for their shared history is at the top of their minds at all times.\n\nJacobsen: «I’ve always had romantic ideas about bands in general, and our band in particular. I never wanted to make music outside of Madrugada. I wanted to make it with the people I started out with».\n\n\nMadrugada are\n\nSivert Høyem\nFrode Jacobsen\nJon Lauvland Pettersen\n\nwith\nCato Thommassen and Christer Knutsen\n\nAlbum discography:\n\n«Industrial Silence» (1999)\n«The Nightly Disease» (2001)\n«Grit» (2002)\n«The Deep End» (2005)\n«Madrugada» (2008)\n«Chimes at Midnight» (2022)\n\nBiography from their site: https:\/\/madrugada.no\/#biography\n\nTheres's another band from the 70's that use the same name:\n\n2) Madrugada was a band from Bergamo, Italy, formed around 1970, and had a long life that lasted until 1978. The group derived from some 60's beat bands like I Condor, that included bass player Alessandro Zanelli and keyboardist Franco Orlandini (from Mat 65 and who later worked with Equipe 84 and Claudio Rocchi), and later changed name to Le Lunghe Storie, and along them from Le Bugie and Gruppo 3. But the basic nucleus came from Terza Classe, which also gave birth to Perdio.\nThough not properly a progressive rock album, their first one, only released in 1974 by Philips, contains some interesting parts. \nIt contains seven tracks, some of which were arranged and signed by Roberto Vecchioni (a singer-songwriter that's still very popular nowadays), while three songs were composed by Mauro Paoluzzi. \nThe first side shows some influences by a West Coast styled sound, with multivocal parts very well executed but not particularly original. Second side contains the long Mandrax, led by Gianfranco Pinto's keyboards, that's probably the best album track.\nExcept for a limited use of acoustic guitar on Uomo blu the band didn't use guitars and their sound was strongly based on keyboards and richly arranged vocal parts.\nSecond album came three years later, this time the trio was helped by some guest musicians like Lucio Fabbri on violin (Piazza delle Erbe and later PFM), the jazz saxophonist Gianluigi Trovesi, and Luciano Ninzatti (from Eugenio Finardi's band Crisalide) on guitar.\nWith a much better production and sound, this can be considered the best of their two albums, with long tracks like the opening Romanzen or Aragon showing a very good composition quality. Another nice song was È triste il vento, that had previously been played by another group from Bergamo that had a close connection with Madrugada, Perdio.\nLike in the first album there are some odd different-styled tracks, like the folky Noter de Berghem and the silly Katmandu (that was also released on single with È triste il vento, but with no success), but Incastro can be surely appreciated by progressive music fans. Unfortunately it didn't have a good promotion by the record company.\nIn concert, Madrugada played on tour with Area, Claudio Rocchi and Biglietto per l'Inferno, and in Lugano (Switzerland) with Kevin Ayers. Moreover they played in many concerts for political movements like Avanguardia Operaia and the Radical Party and the Re Nudo magazine. The band split at the end of the 1970s.\nPinto and Zanelli collaborated with Mauro Paoluzzi in his shortlived Pangea project, which produced only a promotional album in 1976.\nKeyboardist Pinto has collaborated with many Italian and international artists (Patty Pravo, Roberto Vecchioni, Adriano Pappalardo, Riccardo Fogli, Gianna Nannini, Brian Auger), and in the late 90's with the reformed progressive group Perdio.\nHe works in a music school in the Parma area and still plays now in studio, with live bands and in the piano bar circuit.\nBass player Billy Zanelli formed the semi-punk group Judas, with an album on Spaghetti label in 1978, and later played with Roberto Vecchioni.\n\nDiscography\n\nLPs\nMadrugada (Philips, 1974)\nIncastro (Philips, 1977)\n\nCDs\nMadrugada (AMS\/BTF, 2006 \/ Universal, 2010)\nIncastro (AMS\/BTF, 2006 \/ Universal, 2010)\n\nSingles\nKatmandu \/ È triste il vento (Philips, 1977) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Madrugada\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Jeff Beck (born Geoffrey Arnold Beck in Wallington, Surrey, on 24 June 1944; died 10 January 2023) was an English rock guitarist. He rose to prominence with The Yardbirds and after fronted the Jeff Beck Group and Beck, Bogert & Appice. In 1975, he switched to a mainly instrumental style, with a focus on innovative sound, and his releases have spanned genres ranging from blues rock, hard rock, jazz fusion and a blend of guitar-rock and electronica. In 2015, Beck was ranked No. 5 in Rolling Stone' magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists\". \n\nBeck ranked in the top five of Rolling Stone and other magazine's list of 100 greatest guitarists. He was often called a \"guitarist's guitarist\". Rolling Stone describes him as \"one of the most influential lead guitarists in rock\". Although he recorded two hit albums (in 1975 and 1976) as a solo act, Beck did not establish or maintain the sustained commercial success of many of his contemporaries and bandmates. \n\nBeck earned wide critical praise and received the Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance six times and Best Pop Instrumental Performance once. In 2014 he received the British Academy's Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. Beck was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice: as a member of the Yardbirds (1992) and as a solo artist (2009). \n\nBeck was born on 24 June 1944 to Arnold and Ethel Beck at 206 Demesne Road, Wallington, England. As a 10-year-old, Beck sang in a church choir. He attended Sutton Manor Schoo and Sutton East County Secondary Modern School. \n\nBeck cited Les Paul as the first electric guitar player who impressed him. Beck said that he first heard an electric guitar when he was 6 years old and heard Paul playing \"How High the Moon\" on the radio. He asked his mother what it was. After she replied it was an electric guitar and was all tricks, he said, \"That's for me\". Cliff Gallup, lead guitarist with Gene Vincent and the Blue Caps, was also an early musical influence, followed by B.B. King and Steve Cropper. Beck considers Lonnie Mack \"a rock guitarist [who] was unjustly overlooked [and] a major influence on him and many others.\" \n\nAs a teenager he learned to play on a borrowed guitar and made several attempts to build his own instrument, first by gluing and bolting together cigar boxes for the body and an unsanded fence-post for the neck with model aircraft control-lines and frets simply painted on. \n\nUpon leaving school, he attended Wimbledon College of Art, after which he was briefly employed as a painter and decorator, a groundsman on a golf course and a car paint-sprayer. Beck's sister Annetta introduced him to Jimmy Page when both were teenagers. \n\nBeck stopped regular use of a pick in the 1980s. He produces a wide variety of sounds by using his thumb to pluck the strings, his ring finger on the volume knob and his little finger on the vibrato bar on his signature Fender Stratocaster. By plucking a string and then 'fading in' the sound with the volume knob he creates a unique sound that can resemble a human voice, among other effects. He frequently uses a wah-wah pedal both live and in the studio. Eric Clapton once said, \"With Jeff, it's all in his hands\". \n\nAlong with Stratocasters, Beck occasionally played Fender Telecaster and Gibson Les Paul models as well. His amplifiers were primarily Fender and Marshall. In his earlier days with the Yardbirds, Beck also used a 1954 Fender Esquire guitar (now owned by Seymour W. Duncan, and housed in the Cleveland Rock and Roll Hall of Fame) through Vox AC30s. He also played through a variety of fuzz pedals and echo units along with this set-up and has used the Pro Co RAT distortion pedal. The pickup was based on a Gibson pickup rewound by Duncan and used in a salvaged Telecaster dubbed the \"Tele-Gib\" which he had constructed as a gift to Beck. Scott Morgan of the Rationals, who at one point shared a dressing room with the Yardbirds, recalls how Beck amplified his lead guitar through a Vox Superbeetle while using banjo strings for the unwound G string on his guitar because \"they didn't make sets with an unwound G at that point.\" \n\nDuring the ARMS Charity Concerts in 1983 Beck used his battered Fender Esquire along with a 1954 Stratocaster and a Jackson Soloist. On Crazy Legs (1993) he played a Gretsch Duo Jet, his signature Stratocaster and various other guitars. In 2007, Fender created a Custom Shop Tribute series version of his beat-up Fender Esquire as well as his Artist Signature series Stratocaster. \n\nDescribed by Rolling Stone as \"one of the most influential lead guitarists in rock\", Beck cited his major influences as Les Paul, the Shadows, Cliff Gallup, Ravi Shankar, Roy Buchanan, Chet Atkins, Django Reinhardt, Steve Cropper and Lonnie Mack. Of John McLaughlin, Beck said: \"[he] has given us so many different facets of the guitar and introduced thousands of us to world music, by blending Indian music with jazz and classical. I'd say he was the best guitarist alive.\" \n\nAccording to musicologist and historian Bob Gulla, Beck is credited for popularising the use of audio feedback and distortion in rock guitar. Prior to Beck's arrival, guitar playing generally conformed to the \"clean, bright, and jangly\" sounds of early-1960s British Invasion bands or the bluesy aesthetic of 1950s African-American performers like Muddy Waters and Bo Diddley. During his short time with the Yardbirds, Beck's experimentation with feedback, distortion, and \"fuzz\" tone \"pushed the band into directions that would open the door for psychedelic rock\" while \"jolt[ing] British rock forward\", according to Gulla. While Beck was not the first rock guitarist to experiment with electronic distortion, he nonetheless helped to redefine the sound and role of the electric guitar in rock music. Beck's work with the Yardbirds and the Jeff Beck Group's 1968 album Truth were seminal influences on heavy metal music, which emerged in full force in the early 1970s. Gulla identifies one of Beck's characteristic traits to be his sense of pitch, particularly in exercising the whammy bar to create sounds ranging from \"nose-diving bombs to subtle, perfectly pitched harmonic melodies\". \n\nAccording to guitarist and author Jack Wilkins, Beck is regarded alongside Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton as one of his generation's greatest guitarists, receiving praise for his technical skill and versatile playing. Stephen Thomas Erlewine finds him to be \"as innovative as Jimmy Page, as tasteful as Eric Clapton, and nearly as visionary as Jimi Hendrix\", although unable to achieve their mainstream success, \"primarily because of the haphazard way he approached his career\" while often lacking a star singer to help make his music more accessible. On his recorded output by 1991, Erlewine remarked that \"never has such a gifted musician had such a spotty discography\", believing Beck had largely released \"remarkably uneven\" solo records and only \"a few terrific albums\". In Christgau's Record Guide (1981), Robert Christgau essentialised Beck as \"a technician\" and questioned his ability to \"improvise long lines, or jazz it up with a modicum of delicacy, or for that matter get funky\", although he later observed a \"customary focus, loyalty, and consistency of taste\". \n\nIn 2015, Beck was ranked No. 5 in Rolling Stone' magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists\". In an accompanying essay, guitarist Mike Campbell applauded Beck for his \"brilliant technique\" and \"personality\" in his playing, including a sense of humor expressed through the growl of his wah-wah effects. Campbell also credited Beck with expanding the boundaries of the blues, particularly on his two collaborations with Stewart. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Jeff+Beck\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

One (more) name change and musical shift later, Collins came back with Drugdealer, a project with a more laid-back, early-'70s singer\/songwriter vibe.

They are known for their high energy live performances and their pioneering use of social media, and are somewhat of an anomaly in today's music scene. Their sound is almost impossible to categorize, containing elements from almost all the musical movements of the past century.\n\nThe band was formed by brothers Axel and Pål Vindenes, together with school friends Jonas Nielsen and Stian Sævig. All classically trained musicians, the band was formed to play a one-off show at a local youth centre, Ungdomshuset 1880, but after positive response the band continued to play many live shows around Norway. In 2006, the band made their first recording and released the EP Already Your Favourite EP which was produced by Matias Tellez and featured the track \"OOO\".\n\nKakkmaddafakka released its first LP Down to Earth on 24 September 2007, which reached number twenty on the VG Topp30 Album list and brought the band nationwide attention in their native Norway, despite a largely negative critical response.\n\nKakkmaddafakka has performed at numerous festivals including Iceland Airwaves, Montreux Jazz Festival, NXNE, CMJ Music Marathon, Southside Festival, Hurricane Festival, Eurosonic Festival, by:Larm, Area 4 Hove and Melt! Festival in Germany, where they were introduced on stage by prominent Bergen musician and friend Erlend Øye.\n\nIn 2008, Kakkmaddafakka was nominated as Best Norwegian Act in the MTV Europe Music Awards, along with Madcon, Ida Maria, Karpe Diem and eventual winners Erik og Kriss.\n\nOn 25 February 2011, Kakkmaddafakka released their second album Hest. The album was produced by Erlend Øye and released on the label Bubbles. The first single taken from the album was \"Restless\".\n\nOn 28 June 2013, the band released their third album Six Months Is a Long Time. It was again produced by Erlend Øye and released on Universal Music Germany, featuring the singles \"Someone New\", \"Young\", and \"Forever Alone\".\n\nIn early 2014, pianist and founder member Jonas Nielsen left the band and was replaced by Sebastian Emin Kittelsen.\n\nThe band released their fourth album titled KMF on 18 March 2016. \n\nIn 2017, guitarist and singer Pål Vindenes started a parallel solo project under the name Pish. 2017 also brought on their fifth album, Hus.\n\nIn 2019, they released their sixth album, Diplomacy.\n\nBand members include:\nAxel Vindenes - guitar, vocals\nStian Sævig - bass, vocals\nPål Vindenes \"Pish\" - cello, guitar, vocals\nSebastian Kittelsen - piano\nKristoffer Van Der Pas - drums\nLars Helmik Raaheim-Olsen - percussion\n\nFormer members:\nJonas Nielsen - piano, vocals (2004–2014)\n\nAdditional musicians (also called Kakkmaddachoir)\"\nMartin Sande - backing vocals and dancing\nSverre Sande - backing vocals and dancing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kakkmaddafakka\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The current lineup consists of Gahan and Gore.\n\nWith Clarke as their primary songwriter, Depeche Mode released their debut album \"Speak & Spell\" in 1981 during the British new wave movement. Clarke left the band at the end of 1981 and later formed the groups Yazoo and Erasure. Following his departure, Martin Gore became the chief songwriter, and the remaining trio recorded their second album, \"A Broken Frame\" (1982). The band then recruited Alan Wilder, establishing a lineup that remained stable until 1995. This period included the releases of \"Construction Time Again\" (1983) and \"Some Great Reward\" (1984). The albums \"Black Celebration\" (1986) and \"Music for the Masses\" (1987) further established Depeche Mode as a major presence in electronic and alternative music, with their June 1988 concert at the Pasadena Rose Bowl drawing over 60,000 attendees.\n\nIn 1990, the band released their seventh album, \"Violator,\" which reached number seven on the Billboard 200 and was certified triple platinum by the RIAA. The following album, \"Songs of Faith and Devotion\" (1993), was also commercially successful, though internal conflicts during recording and touring led to Wilder's departure in 1995. Depeche Mode continued as a trio of Gahan, Gore, and Fletcher, releasing \"Ultra\" in 1997. Subsequent albums included \"Exciter\" (2001), \"Playing the Angel\" (2005), \"Sounds of the Universe\" (2009), \"Delta Machine\" (2013), and \"Spirit\" (2017) until Fletcher’s death in 2022. Gahan and Gore have continued as a duo, releasing \"Memento Mori\" in 2023.\n\nDepeche Mode have achieved 54 entries on the UK singles chart, 17 Top 10 albums on the UK albums chart, and have sold over 100 million records worldwide. The band has been recognized in Q magazine’s \"50 Bands That Changed the World,\" ranked number 98 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time,\" and in 2016, Billboard named them the 10th Greatest Top Dance Club Artists of All Time.

The group is best known for its 1992 hit single Jump Around.\n\nThe band's history starts with a failed short solo career, Everlast teamed up with DJ Lethal and high school friend Danny Boy to form House of Pain. The group was signed to Tommy Boy Records, and their self-titled debut album (1992) went multi-platinum, spawning the successful DJ Muggs produced single Jump Around.\n\nFashioning themselves as rowdy Irish-American hooligans (Lethal is actually of Latvian heritage), they toured with various rap and alternative-rock bands after their breakthrough. They participated together with Helmet, along with several other rap acts, on the influential 1993 rock-rap collaborative Judgement Night movie soundtrack.\n\nSophomore album and decline in popularity\n\nTheir follow-up effort, 1994's Same As It Ever Was, went gold despite minimal airplay and no major hits. The first single, \"On Point,\" is noted for taking a swipe at another American rapper with a strong Irish heritage, Mark Wahlberg (\"Calvin Klein's no friend of mine\/So I don't like Marky\"). Like Cypress Hill, who, with House of Pain, were a part of the loosely-affiliated Soul Assassins posse, they found urban radio airplay an increasingly closed path, which affected album sales.\n\nThird album\n\nHouse of Pain abruptly broke up in 1996 after the release of their third album, Truth Crushed To Earth Shall Rise Again, which featured guest appearances by rappers Sadat X of Brand Nubian, Guru of Gang Starr, producer\/rapper Divine Styler and reggae singjay Cockni O'Dire (credited as the Scheme Team). On the release date of the album, Everlast announced his departure from the group.\n\nSplit, solo and current affairs\n\nFrom this point on, the status of the group would seem to be in the past tense, though the members would continue their careers separately. Danny Boy would found an art company, DJ Lethal became a member of nu metal band Limp Bizkit, and Everlast would finally get multi-platinum solo fame in 1998. In that year his acoustic rock\/blues-inflected Whitey Ford Sings the Blues album hit the charts, together with the single \"What It's Like\". In 2000, a feud between Everlast and rapper Eminem coincided with the gold-selling Eat at Whitey's, which had minor hits like \"Black Jesus\" and \"Black Coffee\", and featured a collaboration with Carlos Santana. After the sale of the Tommy Boy Records catalogue of master tapes to Warner Bros. Music, Everlast signed with Island\/Def Jam, and released the solo LP White Trash Beautiful in 2004.\n\nLater the same year Rhino Records, a subdivision of Warner Music, has released a hit collection, Shamrocks & Shenanigans, with singles from Everlast's early solo days, the House of Pain and his post-group solo efforts. Prior to the release, Everlast announced on his official message board that he was not endorsing the compilation album.\n\nFounded by Danny Boy in early 2006, La Coka Nostra is a new project that has reunited him, Everlast and DJ Lethal for the first time since House of Pain's split. Other group members include Ill Bill of Non Phixion, and newcomers Slaine and Big Left.\n\nMembers\n\n    * Everlast\n    * Danny Boy\n    * DJ Lethal\n\nAlbums\n\n\tHouse of Pain (Fine Malt Lyrics)\n\n    * Released: July 21, 1992\n    * Billboard 200 chart position: #14\n    * R&B\/Hip-Hop chart position: #16\n    * Singles: \"Jump Around\" & \"Shamrocks and Shenanigans\"\n\n\tSame As It Ever Was\n\n    * Released: June 28, 1994\n    * Billboard 200 chart position: #12\n    * R&B\/Hip-Hop chart position: #12\n    * Singles: \"On Point\", \"Who's The Man?\" & \"Word Is Bond\"\n\n\tTruth Crushed To Earth Shall Rise Again\n\n    * Released: October 10, 1996\n    * Billboard 200 chart position: #47\n    * R&B\/Hip-Hop chart position: #31\n    * Singles: \"Pass The Jinn\" & \"Fed Up\"\n\n\tShamrocks & Shenanigans\n\n    * Released: February 10, 2004\n    * Billboard 200 chart position: #\n    * R&B\/Hip-Hop chart position: #\n    * Singles: -\n\nSingles\n\n    * Jump Around \/ HOP Anthem (1992)\n    * Shamrocks & Shenanigans (US) (1992)\n    * Shamrocks & Shenanigans \/ Who's The Man (UK) (1992)\n    * Top O' The Morning To Ya (Remix) (1992)\n    * Who's The Man?

        "biografia":"Radwimps is a Japanese rock band that formed in their first year of highschool in 2001 in Kanagawa, Japan. They play an eccentric mix of rock, punk, funk and jazz. The band achieved great commercial success in 2006 with their album Radwimps 4: Okazu no Gohan, and are best known for their later singles \"Order Made\" (2008) and \"Dada\" (2011), both of which hit number one on Oricon's single charts.\n\nThe five original members had been friends since middle school. Vocalist Yojiro Noda first became interested in music after hearing Oasis in middle school, when he would try to remember the guitar chords and sing to Oasis songs. He was asked to become the vocalist by a friend, and originally band activities were balanced with basketball. The band's name was formed from two English language slang terms, rad and wimp. According to the band, the coined word had several meanings, including \"excellent weakling\" and \"superlative coward.\"\n\nThe band's activities began centred around Yokohama, with the band performing their first live at live house BB Street in Yokohama's Kannai district on February 5, 2002. At this point, guitarist Akira Kuwahara dropped out of high school in order to focus on the band. In September and August 2002, the band partook in the Yokohama High School Music Festival, and eventually won the grand prize for the competition with the song \"Moshi mo.\" \"Moshi mo\" was released as the band's debut single in May 2003, with 10,000 copies pressed and sold for 100 yen each. Following this single, the band toured the Yokohama area, including a performance as the sole act at Yokohama's Club 24West. The band released their debut album Radwimps in July through independent label Newtraxx, featuring songs written by the band in middle school. The following August, after a guest appearance at the Yokohama High School Music Festival, the band went on hiatus for Noda and other members to focus on their school exams.\n\nRadwimps returned from hiatus in March 2004, however members Kei Asō, Yūsuke Saiki and Akio Shibafumi did not decide to resume band activities. An audition was not held for new members, instead, acquaintances to the band members, drummer Satoshi Yamaguchi and bassist Yusuke Takeda, were added to the group without the members even having their skills trialled. Takeda met the band members in August 2003 as a member of a different band performing in the Yokohama High School Music Festival. The band immediately began recording songs, and by July released a second single, \"Kiseki,\" and performed a three month Japan-wide tour. Immediately after the end of the tour, the band started work on their second album, Radwimps 2: Hatten Tojō, which was finalized by the end of the year and released in March.\n\nDirectly after the release, the band departed on a five month tour, Radwimps Haruna Tour (はるなっTOUR?), and also performed at high profile summer music festivals, such as Setstock, Rock in Japan and Summer Sonic. During this time, the band released a third single, \"Hexun \/ Kanashi,\" which was the band's first charting release.\n\nIn November, the band made their major debut single under Toshiba EMI with the single \"Nijūgoko-me no Senshokutai,\" followed by \"EDP (Tonde Hi ni Iru Natsu no Kimi)\" in January, both top 50 singles. In shifting to a major label, Noda explained that the band took the same stance as they had as an independent band, and that \"If we thought we were bigger on a major label, that would have been a big mistake.\" The band's third and first major label album, Radwimps 3: Mujintō ni Motte Ikiwasureta Ichimai in March 2006, was a landmark in establishing their popularity, debuting at number 13 on Oricon's album charts. Radwimps 3 saw a change in the band's musical style, allowing the band to be more experimental in their sound.\n\nBy the end of 2006 the band's popularity had exponentially grown: the band's album Radwimps 4: Okazu no Gohan, lead with the top 20 singles \"Futarigoto\" and \"Yūshinron\" and top five \"Setsuna Rensa,\" debuted at number five and had an initial shipment of more than 100,000 copies. In this time, the band's older releases, such as Radwimps, Radwimps 2 and \"Kiseki\" began charting for the first time and continued to for extended periods, Radwimps even eventually being certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. In the next three years, both Radwimps and Radwimps 2 charted for approximately 100 weeks, and as of early 2011, Radwimps 3 and Radwimps 4 still continue to chart.\n\nIn 2008, the band received their first number one single, with \"Order Made\", on the Oricon charts. Their 2009 album Altocolony no Teiri sold around 213,000 copies in its first week, debuting at number 2 on the Oricon charts. The band received their second Oricon number one single \"Dada\" in 2011.\n\nThe band gained renewed notoriety in 2016 when they provided the soundtrack for the Makoto Shinkai film \"Kimi no Na wa. (Your Name.)\", which went on to become the highest-grossing anime film in history. One of the four vocal tracks, \"Zenzenzense\", was a #1 hit in Japan. The partnership continued when Radwimps provided the soundtrack for Shinkai's 2019 film \"Weathering With You\".\n\nMembers\n\nVocal & Guitar： Noda Youjirou (野田洋次郎)\nGuitar & Chorus： Kuwahara Akira (桑原 彰)\nBass & Chorus： Takeda Yuusuke (武田祐介)\nDrums & Chorus：Yamaguchi Satoshi (山口智史) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/RADWIMPS\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"Level 42 is an English jazz-funk band formed on the Isle of Wight in 1979. They had the several UK and worldwide hits during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nTheir highest-charting single in the UK was \"Lessons in Love\", which reached number three on the UK Singles Chart, and number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, upon its release in 1986. An earlier single, \"Something About You\", was their most successful chart-wise in the United States, reaching number 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. After much success as a live and studio band in the 1980s, Level 42's commercial profile diminished during the early 1990s following a series of personnel changes and musical shifts. Disbanding in 1994, the band reformed in 2001. \n\nHistory\n1979–1980: Prehistory and formation:\nMark King and the Gould brothers (Phil and Rowland, the latter was generally known by his nickname Boon) were all brought up on the Isle of Wight and played together in various bands during their teenage years. Phil Gould went on to study at London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama, where he met keyboard player Mike Lindup in a percussion course. Both musicians found that they had the same feelings about musical heroes: Miles Davis, John McLaughlin, Keith Jarrett, and Jan Hammer.\n\nBy 1979, Phil Gould and Mark King were both based in London and became involved in Robin Scott's pop project M. While working with M, they became acquainted with Afro-French keyboard player Wally Badarou, who played synthesizer on M's US number-one single \"Pop Muzik\". In late 1979, Phil Gould introduced Mark King and Mike Lindup to each other, and all of them began playing together in loose rehearsal sessions, developing their jazz-funk fusion style. The developing band's original guitarist was Dominic Miller (later to find fame playing with Sting), but he was replaced by Boon Gould on the latter's return from working in the United States.\n\nInitially, instrumental roles were flexible, with Boon Gould also playing bass guitar and saxophone and Lindup doubling on keyboards and drums. Mark King was primarily a drummer (although he also played guitar) but had recently sold his drum kit to pay for transport back to the UK after an ill-fated European venture. With Phil Gould and Boon Gould established (respectively) as the most accomplished drummer and guitarist in the quartet, King opted to learn bass guitar instead. At the time, King was working in a London music store. A notably flexible musician and quick learner, he had observed visiting American funk players demonstrating the thumb-slap bass guitar technique and developed his take on the style in a matter of weeks.\n\nThe developing band (at this point, entirely an instrumental act) took the name Level 42 and settled on a working line-up of King (bass guitar, percussion), Lindup (keyboards, percussion), Boon Gould (guitar, saxophone), and Phil Gould (drums). The name of the band is a reference to the novel The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, in which \"42\" is the answer to \"the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything.\" Having maintained their links with Wally Badarou, Phil Gould, and Mark King invited him to work with Level 42. Although he never formally joined the band, Badarou would become a fifth member in all but name: co-writing songs, playing keyboards and synthesizers in the studio, and co-producing the records.\n\n1980–1983: Early albums (Level 42, The Early Tapes, The Pursuit of Accidents)\nAfter they were seen, jamming together, Level 42 were invited to sign to Elite Records (a small independent label) in 1980. They were also encouraged to branch out into vocal music. Having considered recruiting a singer, the band eventually settled on giving King and Lindup the vocal role. The two men developed a complementary style, with Lindup's falsetto frequently used for harmonies and choruses while King's deep tenor led the verses (although Lindup would also sing entire songs on his own). The Gould brothers generally wrote lyrics while King, Badarou, and Lindup concentrated on Level 42's music.\n\nThe Elite Records single \"Love Meeting Love\" brought the band to the attention of Polydor Records, with whom they signed their second recording contract. In 1981, they released their first Polydor single, \"Love Games\", which became a Top 40 hit. They then cut their critically acclaimed self-titled debut album, which was an immediate success throughout Europe.\n\nThe band quickly established themselves as concert favorites on the budding British and European jazz-funk scene, taking advantage of the musical expertise and performance skills of all four members.[citation needed] Polydor capitalized on the band's success by releasing a second album, The Early Tapes later in the same year. This was a compilation of material from the Elite Records period (and is also known by an alternate name, Strategy).\n\nIn 1982, Level 42 released their third album The Pursuit of Accidents. This was a further development of the Level 42 formula, maintaining their instrumental jazz-funk skills and styling but also experimenting further with pop songs. Both of the singles from the album — \"Weave Your Spell\" and \"The Chinese Way\" — charted. The latter, in particular, raised high in the charts and gained the band a much wider audience than before.\n\n1983–1985: Moving towards pop (Standing in the Light and True Colours):\nA fourth album, Standing in the Light, was released in 1983. Produced by Larry Dunn and Verdine White (of Earth, Wind & Fire), this album began a new era for the band, being less experimental and less jazzy than previous releases. It provided them with their first UK Top Ten hit, \"The Sun Goes Down (Living It Up)\". Notably, the album featured no instrumental tracks, with the band now focusing heavily on songs. (The band would not release another instrumental on an album until 1988's Staring at the Sun).\n\nThe 1984 album True Colours continued the band's development away from primarily jazz-funk based music, switching between funk, power pop, mid-tempo rock, and moody ballads. It yielded the singles \"The Chant Has Begun\" and \"Hot Water\". The latter was a Top 20 hit in Britain and a Top 5 hit in the Netherlands where the band became popular (the song reached also No. 7 in Belgium). During the same year, Mark King released his first solo album Influences on which he played the majority of the instruments (with a guest appearance by Aswad's Drummie Zeb, and with Lindup guesting on additional keyboards).\n\nLevel 42 became known for their power as a live band (as showcased on the 1985 double live album A Physical Presence). For live gigs the band added saxophonist Krys Mach, who toured with the group from 1984 to 1988 and contributed to some album recordings.\n\n1985–1987: Worldwide fame (World Machine and Running in the Family) and split of the original line-up\nBy this time, the band was well established in their mainstream pop\/rock sound, as evidenced on their next studio album, World Machine, released later in 1985. King's dextrous bass playing and Lindup and Badarou's chugging keyboards acted as templates for pop songs such as \"Something About You\" and \"Leaving Me Now\", which were both UK Top 20 hits (Top 40 hits in the Netherlands).\n\nSignificantly, \"Something About You\" was also their first (and only) US Top 10 the following year; also reaching the Top 5 in Canada and the Top 20 in Italy and New Zealand. \"Leaving Me Now\" was the second hit from this album, peaking at No. 15 in the United Kingdom but proving less successful in Europe. Elements of Level 42's roots could still be found in the funky \"Coup d'État\" and \"Dream Crazy\" on the UK version of the album, as well as a long instrumental track named \"Hell,\" which was also recorded during the World Machine sessions (This last track did not see the light of day until the early 2000s as an MP3 download on the original Napster).\n\nWorld Machine gained positive reviews from critics, with AllMusic journalist William Cooper, in a retrospective review, describing it as \"one of the finest pop albums of the mid-'80s.\" During the recording of the album, the first major tensions between Phil Gould and Mark King began to surface over musical direction, production, and their relationship. This clashing led to Gould leaving the band for a week. Allan Holdsworth's drummer Gary Husband was lined up as a potential replacement, but Gould and King's dispute was subsequently patched up and the group went on to enjoy their most successful year to date.\n\nReleased in early 1986 (and initially recorded to keep up the band's European chart momentum while the band was busy touring the United States), \"Lessons in Love\" was an international hit and became Level 42's biggest selling single.[citation needed] It gave the band their first number one in Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, and South Africa, increasing the band's popularity considerably. It also placed at No. 2 in Italy, the Netherlands, and Sweden, No. 3 in the UK and Ireland, No. 4 in Austria, No. 10 in Norway, No. 12 in the US in 1987, No. 18 in New Zealand, and No. 22 in France).\n\n\"Lessons in Love\" became the lead single on 1987's Running in the Family album, recorded to capitalize on the impact. With the band now at the peak of their success, the album added further gloss to Level 42's polished pop sound (despite adding to Phil Gould's disquiet). Further singles from the album continued and built on the band's existing profile: \"To Be With You Again\" (No. 6 in the Netherlands and Ireland), the ballad \"It's Over\" (No. 3 in Ireland and No. 7 in the Netherlands) and Running In The Family's title track (No. 1 in Denmark, No. 3 in the Netherlands, No. 4 in Ireland, No. 5 in Switzerland, No. 7 in Norway and No. 9 in New Zealand). The album itself was a major international success, reaching the Top 10 in numerous countries.\n\nBy now a leading British pop band, Level 42 played at the Prince's Trust concert in June 1987, with Eric Clapton standing in on lead guitar for a performance of \"Running in the Family\". King and Lindup also performed with artists including Ben E. King on \"Stand By Me\" and George Harrison and Ringo Starr on \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\".\n\nDespite the success, Level 42 was on the brink of splitting up. Although Phil Gould was the most visibly dissatisfied member, Boon Gould was the first to leave, departing in late 1987, following a support slot on a Madonna tour. The quietest member of the band, Boon surprised both King and Lindup with his sudden departure. However, he had been suffering from nervous exhaustion and wanted to leave the lifestyle of a constantly touring musician to settle down and spend more time with his wife and children. Boon's relationship with the band remained amicable and, although he would not return to Level 42 as a performing or recording member, he continued to write lyrics for the band following his departure. Paul Gendler (an experienced session player who had previously been the guitarist for Modern Romance) temporarily replaced him for a six-week headlining tour and further support slots with Tina Turner.\n\nIn December 1987, midway through the tour, Phil Gould left Level 42 permanently. Like his brother, he was suffering from exhaustion, but his relationship with King had broken down once again and they now found it difficult to work together. Phil was also reportedly dissatisfied with the band's direction in terms of their newer \"pop\" sound, and King and Lindup failed to convince him to stay. To complete the tour dates, the band hired Prefab Sprout drummer Neil Conti to fill in.\n\n1988–1989: The second line-up (Staring at the Sun):\nFollowing the tour, Level 42 recruited Gary Husband as the band's new full-time drummer. He in turn recommended Steve Topping as a replacement guitarist. However, Topping and King's personalities clashed and Topping eventually left the band in early 1988 after initial writing and rehearsing sessions in Dublin. Most of the next Level 42 album, Staring at the Sun, was recorded without a permanent guitarist. Rhythm guitar on the studio recordings was handled either by the band's old friend Dominic Miller or by an uncredited Mark King. In April 1988, towards the end of the sessions, the band recruited lead guitarist Alan Murphy (a session guitarist who had worked extensively with Kate Bush and had been a member of Go West).\n\nStaring at the Sun was released in 1988, reaching number 2 in the UK and the top ten in several European charts. It included the hit single \"Heaven in My Hands\" (number 12 in the UK and the top twenty in the Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland). Boon Gould had co-written many of the tracks with King, Lindup, and Badarou, while Gary Husband was credited with his first co-write with King on \"Tracie\" (a tribute to King's childhood sweetheart). To promote the album, Level 42 embarked on a four-month European tour, culminating in six sell-out nights at Wembley Arena. These latter dates were recorded for what would become the band's second live album, Live At Wembley (eventually released in 1996).\n\nAlthough the band seemed to have maintained their momentum and recovered well from the split of the original lineup, they were about to be hit by a serious tragedy. Unknown to the rest of Level 42, guitarist Alan Murphy was suffering from AIDS, something that he may have been aware of before joining the band. At the time, his previous band Go West had been stalled by internal disagreements, and one of Murphy's reasons for joining Level 42 was to ensure that he spent his last days playing the music that he loved. During 1989, Murphy contracted pneumonia: weakened by his existing condition, his decline was rapid and he died on 19 October 1989.\n\nDevastated, Level 42 took a year off to regroup and rethink. To cover the gap and to fulfill the band's contract with Polydor Records, Level Best (a greatest hits compilation) was released at the end of 1989; also marking a decade since the band's beginnings. During the break, Mike Lindup also recorded and released his debut solo album, Changes (featuring Dominic Miller, Pino Palladino on bass and Manu Katché on drums).\n\n1990–1992: Third and fourth lineups – Guaranteed album, Allan Holdsworth and Jakko Jakszyk:\nThe band signed a new contract with RCA Records in 1990, for whom they produced their next album, Guaranteed. Although Dominic Miller once again handled most of the rhythm guitar work, Gary Husband asked Allan Holdsworth to provide some guitar work (notably on \"A Kinder Eye\"). As well as drumming, Husband also played keyboards and increased his songwriting role, co-writing many tracks with King, Lindup, and Badarou. The album features the only track entirely written by Husband – \"If You Were Mine\" – that also featured on the \"Guaranteed\" single release. Mark King also collaborated with lyricists Drew Barfield and George Green to expand the songwriting. Guaranteed was well received by American music critics. However, the album did not get good reviews in the UK (despite reaching No. 3 in the UK charts while the title track reached No. 17 in the singles charts) and was ultimately less commercially successful than previous efforts.\n\nIn December 1990, Level 42 returned to play a record run of concerts at Hammersmith Odeon, London, in part fulfilling booking obligations preceding the band's recent hiatus. The concerts featured Allan Holdsworth (whom Husband had asked to play as a favor while the band searched for a permanent guitarist) plus four additional players: Lyndon Connah (ex-64 Spoons) on additional keyboards and percussion and sharing backing vocals with Annie McCaig, plus the horn section from the Guaranteed album (John Thirkell and Gary Barnacle).\n\nAfter the recording of Guaranteed and a weeklong promotional tour, Level 42 needed a permanent guitarist. Mark King assumed (erroneously) that Allan Holdsworth would not be interested in taking the position. Instead, the band recruited well-respected art-pop guitarist, session player, and sometime solo artist Jakko Jakszyk: the former frontman for 64 Spoons, he had also collaborated with Tom Robinson, Sam Brown, and Stewart\/Gaskin among others. Although he did not play on Guaranteed, Jakszyk appeared on the album's cover photo and took part in promotional duties and the tour for the album, as well as playing on two B-sides from this era (\"At This Great Distance\" and \"As Years Go By\").\n\nUnlike Husband, Jakszyk never became a full legal member of the band (apparently due to \"record company politics\"). However, following the end of promotion for Guaranteed, the King-Lindup-Husband-Jakszyk line began writing and recording new material together, with at least two songs (\"Fire\" and \"Free Your Soul\") completed. Following the next development in the band's history, this work was shelved and remains unreleased.\n\n1993–1994: Fifth and sixth lineups (including the brief return of Phil Gould), Forever Now and disbandment\nIn early 1993, Gary Husband left Level 42, leading to the return of group founder member Phil Gould as Level 42's drummer (and principal lyricist) for 1994's Forever Now album. Further changes to the band were evident in that Jakko Jakszyk did not play on the album: the American session guitarist Danny Blume (erroneously credited as “Danny Bloom” performed all guitars.\n\nAlthough Forever Now was a critical success, the reunion of Gould and the group was short-lived. When Level 42 began to promote the new album (with Jakszyk returning to the live band for concerts and TV appearances), Gould played only one promotional gig and did not go on the road for the Forever Now tour. Jakszyk’s friend and frequent collaborator Gavin Harrison (who later played drums for both Porcupine Tree and King Crimson) replaced him as a live drummer.\n\nIt was announced halfway through the Forever Now tour, on the day of the Manchester Apollo gig, which the band would be disbanding permanently following their concert commitments. Level 42 played their last gig at the Albert Hall in London on 14 October 1994. According to Jakszyk, the band recorded tapes for a live album during the final 1994 shows at the Albert Hall and the Brighton Dome which \"sounded fantastic\", but the album was never released.\n\n1996–2000: Mark King's solo years:\nIn 1996, Mark King signed to Virgin Records and released a solo single \"Bitter Moon\" (with Lyndon Connah playing keyboards). This was followed up by his second solo album One Man, featuring lyrics by Boon Gould. The album was not a big commercial success. \n\nKing later toured as a solo act, playing his new compositions and some Level 42 favorites. In 1999, he played some shows at the Jazz Cafe in London under the name of \"The Mark King Group\" with a band including Husband, Jakszyk, and Jakszyk's fellow former 64 Spoons colleague Lyndon Connah on keyboards. Jakszyk left the band after the Jazz Cafe shows, to be replaced on guitar by Nathan King (Mark King's younger brother). King continued to tour with this band, now renamed \"Grupo Mark King\", over the next couple of years, augmenting the line-up with saxophone player Sean Freeman.\n\nIn August 1999, three-quarters of the original Level 42 line-up reunited for a private show. Phil Gould invited some musician friends to play at a party, including his brother Boon and Mike Lindup. In 2001, Mark King, Mike Lindup, and Phil Gould played together at Lindup's wedding for the first time in ten years.[citation needed]\n\n2001–2005: Return of Level 42 (seventh lineup):\nAlthough Mark King released two solo albums, his previous band's music proved to be persistently popular and he found that he was playing more and more old Level 42 tracks at live shows.\n\nIn late 2001, King came to a business agreement with Mike Lindup and bought the rights to the name Level 42. Although Lindup agreed to play on future albums, he did not want to tour.[citation needed] King announced the return of Level 42 with a new line-up which also happened to be the musicians from his current live band: himself, Husband, Connah, Freeman, and Nathan King. On 12 July 2002, the first official Level 42 concert for six years was played at The Circus Tavern in Purfleet, Essex. While not recording any new material, for the next few years the band settled into a regular pattern of touring and playing old hits.\n\nOn 13 February 2005, there was a brief one-night reunion with Mike Lindup (who joined the band onstage for a date at The Forum in London)[citation needed] and over the year, there was a burst of reissue activity. Two Rockpalast shows from 1983 and 1984 were released on DVD, followed by two CD releases: The River Sessions (a live show from 1983 recorded in Scotland) and a new compilation called The Ultimate Collection II. The latter included a new song called \"Genius Of Love\", which was a Level 42 tribute\/collaboration by the Italian-American dance producer Hardage, featuring Mark King on vocals and incorporating a sample of the Level 42 track \"I Want Eyes\".\n\n2006–2012: Retroglide and further tours and lineup changes:\nIn February 2006, after twelve years without releasing a new studio album, Level 42 announced the release of Retroglide. While billed as a band album, it was chiefly recorded and produced by King at his home studio, with Gary Husband, Lyndon Connah, Sean Freeman, and Nathan King all contributing.\n\nRetroglide also featured input from two previous Level 42 members. Erstwhile guitarist Boon Gould provided the album's lyrics (as well as contributing a guitar solo on \"Ship\") and Mike Lindup, who added prominent keyboard parts and vocals to many tracks, effectively expanded the band to a six-piece via extensive guest performances. Although Phil Gould was uncredited on the album, the track \"Ship\" is the first song since 1986 worked on by all four original members, as Phil originally arranged the track with his brother Boon. However, Retroglide was also the first Level 42 album not to feature any contributions from Wally Badarou.\n\nIn May 2006, Level 42 announced that Mike Lindup would return full-time to replace Lyndon Connah on keyboards. Retroglide was promoted via a supporting tour throughout the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and several other European countries during October 2006. On 26 August 2007, Level 42 played an outdoor gig at the Arundel Festival in West Sussex: the band's only UK show of the year. In 2008, Level 42 played a twenty-date UK tour.\n\nIn 2010, Husband stepped down as Level 42's drummer for the second time, due to prior commitments with John McLaughlin. Pete Ray Biggin replaced Husband. In 2012, Level 42 toured the UK and mainland Europe, in celebration of the 25th anniversary since the release of Running in the Family, by playing the whole album, with a whole array of other hits. Also included in the shows was an acoustic set, with Mike Lindup playing the accordion. In October 2012, on Mark King's birthday during a gig in Bristol, Boon Gould joined the band on stage.\n\n2013–present: \"Sirens\" EP series and re-engagement with contemporary dance-pop:\nOn 20 and 21 September 2013, Level 42 (joined by an expanded brass section), performed three new songs at London's Indigo O2 Arena – \"Where's Yo' Head At\", \"Too Much Time\", and \"Sirens\". All of these appeared on the band's first new release for seven years, the six-song studio EP \"Sirens\" (released on 31 October 2013, and the first output from the band's new self-owned label Level 42 Records). Mixed by the American DJ John Morales, the EP also contained \"Mind on You\", \"My Independence Day\" and \"Build Myself a Rocket\" (with King's daughter Marlee providing the backing vocals on the last of these tracks). Musically, it built on the production approach of Retroglide while allying the band with contemporary developments in R&B and dance electronic.\n\nOn 3 December 2013, the band announced 'The Sirens Tour' – a 30-date tour, starting in October 2014 and taking in the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Italy. In the summer of 2014, the band performed at several festivals across Europe including headline performances at Let's Rock Bristol and Rochester Castle. They also played at Rewind festivals. At a performance in Bournemouth, ex-drummer Gary Husband returned due to Pete Ray Biggin being unavailable.\n\nIn 2015, the band appeared at a number of the UK and European festivals headlining at 'Let's Rock the Moor' and 'Carfest' concerts. They also played two nights at the Indigo2 in London where the band once again featured a larger brass section consisting of Dan Carpenter (trumpet) and Nicol Thomson (trombone) as well as regular saxophonist Sean Freeman.\n\nIn 2016, Level 42 performed at several festivals across the UK and Europe as well as in Curaçao, Chile, and Argentina before embarking on the UK, Netherlands, and Scandinavian tour to promote the \"Sirens II\" EP. On 1 May 2019, it was announced that Boon Gould had been found dead at his home in Dorset. He was 64. On 4 July 2019, Level 42 made a rare North American incursion, being the band to perform the first concert to launch the week-long «Festival d'été de Québec» (Quebec City Summer Festival). A rare treat for North American fans. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Level+42\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

        "biografia":"El Cuarteto de Nos is an Uruguayan alternative rock band formed in 1984 in Montevideo. The band was originally comprised of the Musso brothers (Roberto and Riki Musso) and Santiago Tavella, who they had met in high school. In 1984 they released their debut album, a split LP with uruguayan candombe musician Alberto Wolf under the Ayuí \/ Tacuabé label. Leonardo Baroncini was hired to be a guest drummer on the record.\n\nIn March 1987 they released Soy una arveja, an album which unlike their previous record featured dark, humorous and satirical lyrics based around characters from the city of Tajo, a fictional city (an inside-joke between the members). This would also be their first album to feature the drummer Álvaro Pintos.\nThey would later release Emilio Garcia in 1988 and Canciones del Corazon in 1991. However, in 1994 with the release of Otra navidad en las trincheras the band unexpectedly gained massive popularity in Uruguay and stopped being a cult band. This caused Otra navidad en las trincheras to become the #1 best selling album in the country for a long time.\n\nAfter the success of their previous album they released Barranca Abajo, a concept album revolving around the life of a fictional character named José Barrancas created by the band. The next year El tren bala was released and generated controversy throughout the country due to the Ministry of Education and Culture's attempts to ban the album over the song \"El dia que Artigas se emborracho\" which made fun of uruguayan national hero José Gervasio Artigas. However, this only expanded the group's popularity. Afterwards Revista ¡¡Ésta!! was released in 1998.\n\nRiki Musso temporarily left the band in 2000 before the release of Cortamambo due to differences with their label and bandmates about the album cover. However, his brother convinced him to stay. Their 2004 self-titled album was the first to feature Juan Campodonico who would later produce all of their post-Cortamambo discography including Raro, a power pop album which made the band well known in other countries, allowing them to tour through South America. Riki would leave the band a second time due to musical differences with Bipolar being his last contribution to El Cuarteto de Nos.\n\nGustavo Antuña replaced guitarist Riki Musso in 2010 and joined the band alongside keyboardist Santiago Marrero. The first album to feature them both was the more pop rock influenced Porfiado which won two latin grammy awards. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/El+Cuarteto+De+Nos\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
